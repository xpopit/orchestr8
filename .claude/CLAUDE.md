# Claude Code Orchestration System

This is an enterprise-grade orchestration system that enables autonomous end-to-end project completion through hierarchical multi-agent coordination.

## System Architecture

You have access to a hierarchical orchestration system with:

### Layer 1: Meta-Orchestrators
- Use `project-orchestrator` for end-to-end project coordination
- Use `feature-orchestrator` for complete feature development lifecycle
- Use `workflow-coordinator` for cross-agent workflow management

### Layer 2: Specialized Agents
**Development:** architect, frontend-developer, backend-developer, fullstack-developer, api-designer, database-specialist
**Quality:** code-reviewer, test-engineer, security-auditor, performance-analyzer, accessibility-expert
**DevOps:** ci-cd-engineer, docker-specialist, kubernetes-expert, infrastructure-engineer
**Documentation:** technical-writer, api-documenter, architecture-documenter
**Analysis:** requirements-analyzer, dependency-analyzer, code-archaeologist

**Agent Selection via Registry:**
The system includes a comprehensive **agent-registry.yml** (`.claude/agent-registry.yml`) that provides intelligent agent selection:
- **Role-based mapping**: Logical roles (system_architect, frontend_developer, etc.) mapped to specific agents
- **Primary + fallback agents**: Automatic fallback if primary agent unavailable
- **Capability tags**: Each agent tagged with expertise areas for smart matching
- **Model recommendations**: Sonnet for strategic orchestration, Haiku for tactical execution
- **Use case guidance**: When to use each agent with specific examples

Reference the agent registry when selecting agents to ensure optimal task assignment with built-in resilience.

### Layer 3: Skills
Skills are automatically activated based on context. Available categories: languages, frameworks, tools, practices, domains.

### Layer 4: Workflows
Use slash commands for end-to-end automation: `/new-project`, `/add-feature`, `/refactor`, `/fix-bug`, `/security-audit`, `/optimize-performance`, `/deploy`

## Core Operating Principles

### 1. Plan-Then-Execute Methodology
**ALWAYS** follow this pattern:
1. **Analyze** requirements thoroughly
2. **Design** solution architecture
3. **Plan** detailed implementation steps
4. **Ask for approval** before coding
5. **Execute** implementation
6. **Validate** at each quality gate
7. **Document** changes

**DO NOT** start coding immediately. Take time to think and plan.

### 2. Orchestration Pattern
For complex tasks:
1. **Decompose** into subtasks
2. **Assign** to specialized agents via Task tool
3. **Execute** agents in parallel when possible
4. **Monitor** progress and dependencies
5. **Synthesize** results
6. **Validate** integration

### 3. Quality Gates
Every change must pass through appropriate gates:
- **Design Gate**: Architecture review, feasibility
- **Implementation Gate**: Code review, style compliance
- **Test Gate**: All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e)
- **Security Gate**: No vulnerabilities, secrets, or compliance issues
- **Performance Gate**: Meets performance requirements
- **Accessibility Gate**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance (for UI)

### 4. Context Management
**Optimize token usage:**
- Fork context for specialized agents
- Summarize results, don't paste full outputs
- Reference files instead of pasting content
- Keep orchestrator context compact
- Store details in files, not conversation

### 5. Error Handling
**Always be resilient:**
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Provide graceful degradation
- Have rollback strategies
- Log errors comprehensively
- Recover automatically when possible

## Development Standards

### Code Quality
- Follow SOLID principles

- Focus indicators
- Error messages accessible

## Orchestration Workflow

### For Large Projects
```
1. Use `project-orchestrator` agent
2. Provide high-level requirements
3. Orchestrator will:
   - Analyze requirements (requirements-analyzer)
   - Design architecture (architect)
   - Decompose into features
   - Coordinate specialized agents
   - Validate at each gate
   - Generate documentation
   - Deploy to environment
```

### For New Features
```
1. Use `feature-orchestrator` agent or `/add-feature` command
2. Provide feature description
3. Orchestrator will:
   - Analyze requirements
   - Design implementation
   - Implement (frontend/backend/fullstack)
   - Write tests (test-engineer)
   - Review code (code-reviewer)
   - Check security (security-auditor)
   - Update documentation
```

### For Bug Fixes
```
1. Use `/fix-bug` command
2. Provide bug description and reproduction steps
3. Workflow:
   - Reproduce bug
   - Identify root cause (code-archaeologist if needed)
   - Design fix
   - Implement fix
   - Write regression test
   - Validate fix
   - Update docs if needed
```

### For Refactoring

1. Use `/refactor` command
2. Specify code to refactor and goals
3. Workflow:
   - Analyze current code
   - Design refactoring strategy
   - Ensure tests exist (write if missing)
   - Refactor incrementally
   - Verify tests still pass
   - Validate no behavior change
   - Update documentation
```

### For Security Audits
```
1. Use `/security-audit` command
2. Workflow:
   - Dependency scanning
   - Static analysis (SAST)
   - Secret detection
   - Code review for vulnerabilities
   - Generate security report
   - Prioritize findings
   - Create remediation plan
```

### For Performance Optimization
```
1. Use `/optimize-performance` command
2. Specify target (frontend, backend, database, etc.)
3. Workflow:
   - Profile current performance
   - Identify bottlenecks
   - Design optimizations
   - Implement changes
   - Benchmark improvements
   - Validate no regressions
   - Document optimizations
```

## Agent Invocation Guidelines

### When to Use Orchestrators
- Complex, multi-step tasks
- Full project lifecycle
- Multiple domain areas
- Requires coordination

### When to Use Specialized Agents
- Single domain task
- Clear, focused goal
- Known requirements
- Parallel execution possible

### When to Use Skills
- Skills are auto-activated, don't explicitly invoke
- They provide context-specific expertise
- They augment agent capabilities

### When to Use Workflows
- Standardized, repeatable processes
- End-to-end automation
- Quality gates required
- Documentation needed

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### DO NOT
- ❌ Start coding without a plan
- ❌ Skip quality gates to "move faster"
- ❌ Commit secrets or credentials
- ❌ Write code without tests
- ❌ Ignore security vulnerabilities
- ❌ Skip documentation
- ❌ Merge without code review
- ❌ Deploy without validation
- ❌ Ignore performance issues
- ❌ Violate accessibility standards

### DO
- ✅ Plan thoroughly before executing
- ✅ Use appropriate orchestrators/agents
- ✅ Execute agents in parallel when possible
- ✅ Validate at each quality gate
- ✅ Write comprehensive tests
- ✅ Document decisions and changes
- ✅ Follow security best practices
- ✅ Optimize for performance
- ✅ Ensure accessibility
- ✅ Handle errors gracefully

## Observability

### Logging
- Use structured logging (JSON format)
- Include correlation IDs
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- Log agent invocations and results
- Log quality gate pass/fail

### Monitoring
- Track token usage per task
- Monitor agent execution time
- Measure quality gate success rates
- Track error rates
- Monitor performance metrics

### Tracing
- Trace request flow across agents
- Identify bottlenecks
- Optimize critical paths
- Visualize dependencies

## Emergency Procedures

### Rollback
If something breaks:
1. Identify last known good state
2. Use git to revert changes
3. Rollback database migrations if needed
4. Redeploy previous version
5. Verify rollback success
6. Post-mortem analysis

### Circuit Breaker
If an agent repeatedly fails:
1. Stop using that agent
2. Fallback to alternative approach
3. Log failure details
4. Investigate root cause
5. Fix and re-enable

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Plan first, code later** - Think before acting
2. **Use orchestrators** - For complex, multi-domain tasks
3. **Parallelize** - Execute independent agents concurrently
4. **Validate constantly** - Quality gates at every step
5. **Optimize context** - Fork, summarize, reference files
6. **Test comprehensively** - Unit, integration, e2e, performance
7. **Secure by default** - Security at every layer
8. **Document thoroughly** - For humans and agents
9. **Monitor everything** - Logs, metrics, traces
10. **Recover gracefully** - Error handling and rollback
