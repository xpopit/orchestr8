## [1.3.0] - 2025-11-02

### 🔍 Multi-Stage Iterative Code Review System

**Major New Capability: Comprehensive Code Review Workflows**

This release adds a sophisticated multi-stage iterative code review system that evaluates code across 5 quality dimensions with specialized agents and automated iteration cycles.

### ✨ New Agent (1 orchestrator)

**Code Review Orchestrator**
- **`code-review-orchestrator`** - Orchestrates comprehensive multi-stage iterative code reviews
  - Coordinates 5 specialized review stages (style, logic, security, performance, architecture)
  - Parallel execution of independent stages for speed
  - Aggregates findings from all stages into unified report
  - Enables iterative improvement cycles with targeted re-reviews
  - Supports multiple review modes (full, fast, security-focused, performance-focused)
  - Generates detailed reports with prioritized, actionable feedback
  - Integrates with GitHub for PR comments and status updates

### 🔄 New Workflows (3 review workflows)

**1. `/review-code` - Multi-Stage Code Review**
- Comprehensive code review with all 5 quality dimensions
- Stages: Style & Readability → Logic & Correctness → Security → Performance → Architecture
- Supports full codebase, directory, file, or PR reviews
- Multiple modes: full review (~50 min), fast (~15 min), security-focused, performance-focused
- Iterative improvement with targeted re-reviews
- Generates master review report with prioritized findings
- **Use for:** Pre-commit reviews, pre-PR reviews, comprehensive quality validation

**2. `/review-pr` - Pull Request Review**
- Specialized PR review with GitHub integration
- Fetches PR metadata, changed files, commits, and diff
- Validates PR title, description, and metadata
- Multi-stage code analysis on changed files only
- Posts detailed review summary to PR comments
- Creates inline comments for critical issues
- Sets PR review status (approve/request changes)
- Applies labels based on findings
- Supports iterative re-review on new commits
- **Use for:** Automated PR reviews, quality gates before merge, GitHub Actions integration

**3. `/review-architecture` - Architecture Review**
- Deep architecture and system design review
- Analyzes 8 dimensions: pattern, SOLID, scalability, security, technical debt, API, data, integration
- Evaluates architecture pattern appropriateness and violations
- Assesses SOLID principles compliance
- Reviews scalability (horizontal/vertical), caching, async processing
- Security architecture evaluation (defense in depth, auth/authz)
- Technical debt quantification and prioritization
- API design and integration patterns review
- Generates Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
- Creates improvement roadmap (immediate, short-term, long-term)
- **Use for:** Pre-release audits, major refactoring planning, system design validation

### 🎯 Review Stages

All review workflows leverage a consistent 5-stage architecture:

1. **Stage 1: Style & Readability (15%)** - Quick pass on formatting, naming, documentation
2. **Stage 2: Logic & Correctness (25%)** - Business logic, algorithms, error handling, edge cases
3. **Stage 3: Security Audit (20%)** - OWASP Top 10, vulnerabilities, input validation, secrets
4. **Stage 4: Performance Analysis (20%)** - N+1 queries, algorithm complexity, resource management, caching
5. **Stage 5: Architecture Review (15%)** - Design patterns, SOLID principles, scalability, technical debt
6. **Stage 6: Synthesis (5%)** - Aggregate findings, resolve conflicts, prioritize issues, generate report

### 🔄 Iterative Improvement

**Smart Re-Review System:**
- After developer fixes issues, targeted re-review of only affected stages
- Validates fixes don't introduce new issues
- Maximum 3 iterations before escalating to pair programming
- Tracks iteration count and time to approval

### 📊 Review Outputs

**Comprehensive Reports:**
- Executive summary with overall quality score
- Issues categorized by severity (Critical 🔴, High 🟠, Medium 🟡, Low 🔵, Suggestions 💡)
- Stage-by-stage findings with file:line references
- Positive feedback on what was done well
- Improvement roadmap (immediate, short-term, long-term)
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for key recommendations

**GitHub Integration:**
- Inline comments on specific lines
- PR review summary as comment
- Review status (approve/request changes)
- Label application based on findings
- Re-review automation on new commits

### 🚀 Key Features

**Parallel Execution:**
- Stages 1-3 run in parallel for speed
- Reduces review time from 90+ minutes to ~50 minutes

**Multiple Review Modes:**
- **Full Review:** All 5 stages, comprehensive (~50 min)
- **Fast Review:** Logic + Security only, for hotfixes (~15 min)
- **Security-Focused:** Deep security audit with compliance checks (~30 min)
