- Query agents by specialization or use case
- Load agent definitions JIT (instead of loading all 69 agents)
- **Example:** "Find agents that handle authentication"

### 🎯 Use Cases

**1. JIT Context Loading for Agents**
```
Traditional: Load entire codebase (50k tokens)
New: Query "authentication functions" → 5 results (500 tokens)
Savings: 80-90% token reduction
```

**2. Multi-Project Code Intelligence**
```
Single database indexes multiple projects
Switch between projects seamlessly

Fast re-indexing (seconds vs minutes)
```

**4. Semantic Code Discovery**
```
Query: "Find rate limiting implementations"
Result: Functions with similar embeddings
No need to load entire codebase
Discover code you didn't know existed
```

**5. Call Graph Analysis**
```
