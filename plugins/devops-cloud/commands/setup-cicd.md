  echo "⚠️  Unknown CI platform: $CI_PLATFORM, defaulting to github-actions"
  CI_PLATFORM="github-actions"
fi

echo "✅ Project analyzed and CI/CD strategy defined"

## Phase 4: Deployment & Monitoring (75-100%)

**⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
```
Use the devops-engineer agent to:
1. Add Docker build and push (if applicable)
2. Configure staging deployment
3. Configure production deployment with approvals
4. Add deployment health checks
5. Set up monitoring and alerting
6. Create rollback procedures

subagent_type: "devops-cloud:devops-engineer"
description: "Configure deployment and monitoring"
prompt: "Configure deployment automation and monitoring:

Pipeline File: $PIPELINE_FILE
CI Platform: $CI_PLATFORM
Strategy: cicd-strategy.md

Tasks:

1. **Docker Build & Push** (if applicable)
   - Multi-stage Dockerfile optimization
   - Build Docker image
   - Tag with commit SHA and version
   - Push to registry (Docker Hub, ECR, GCR, ACR)
   - Scan image with Trivy

   Example:
   \`\`\`yaml
   docker:
     needs: [test, security-scan]
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
     steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
       - uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
       - uses: docker/login-action@v3
         with:
           registry: ghcr.io
           username: \${{ github.actor }}
           password: \${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
       - uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
         with:
           push: true
           tags: |
             ghcr.io/org/app:\${{ github.sha }}
             ghcr.io/org/app:latest
           cache-from: type=gha
           cache-to: type=gha,mode=max
   \`\`\`

2. **Staging Deployment**
   - Deploy on main branch push
   - Automatic deployment to staging
   - Run smoke tests
   - Health check validation

   Example (Kubernetes):
   \`\`\`yaml
   deploy-staging:
     needs: [docker]
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     environment: staging
     steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
       - uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
       - run: |
           kubectl set image deployment/app app=ghcr.io/org/app:\${{ github.sha }}
           kubectl rollout status deployment/app -n staging
       - name: Smoke Tests
         run: curl -f https://staging.app.com/health
   \`\`\`

3. **Production Deployment**
   - Manual approval required (GitHub Environments)
   - Deploy after staging validation
   - Blue-green or canary deployment
   - Health checks and validation
   - Automatic rollback on failure

   Example:
   \`\`\`yaml

     needs: [deploy-staging]
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     environment:
       name: production
       url: https://app.com
     steps:
       - uses: actions/checkout@v4
       - uses: azure/setup-kubectl@v3
       - name: Deploy
         run: |
           kubectl set image deployment/app app=ghcr.io/org/app:\${{ github.sha }}
           kubectl rollout status deployment/app -n production
       - name: Health Check
         run: |
           for i in {1..30}; do
             if curl -f https://app.com/health; then
               echo \"Health check passed\"
               exit 0
             fi
             sleep 10
           done
           echo \"Health check failed, rolling back\"
           kubectl rollout undo deployment/app -n production
           exit 1
   \`\`\`

4. **Deployment Health Checks**
   - Application health endpoint
   - Database connectivity
   - External service dependencies
   - Performance baseline validation
   - Rollback on failure

5. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Deployment notifications (Slack, Discord, email)
   - Error rate monitoring
   - Performance metrics
   - Log aggregation
   - Alert on anomalies

   Example (Slack notification):
   \`\`\`yaml
   notify:
     needs: [deploy-production]
     if: always()
     runs-on: ubuntu-latest
     steps:
       - uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
         with:
           status: \${{ job.status }}
           text: 'Deployment \${{ job.status }}'
           webhook_url: \${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
   \`\`\`

6. **Rollback Procedures**

Expected outputs:
- Updated pipeline with deployment jobs
- Staging deployment configured
- Production deployment with approvals
- Health checks implemented
- Monitoring/alerting configured
- rollback-guide.md
- deployment-guide.md
"
```

**Expected Outputs:**

- Staging and production deployment configured
- Health checks implemented
- Monitoring and alerting configured
- `rollback-guide.md` - Rollback procedures
- `deployment-guide.md` - Deployment documentation

**Quality Gate: Deployment Validation**

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ Don't skip security scanning to "move faster"
❌ Don't deploy without testing
❌ Don't ignore build warnings
❌ Don't commit secrets to repository
❌ Don't skip health checks on deployment
❌ Don't deploy to production without staging validation
❌ Don't forget to configure caching (slow builds)
❌ Don't skip rollback testing
❌ Don't ignore failed quality gates
❌ Don't hardcode credentials in pipeline

✅ Do use secret management (GitHub Secrets, GitLab Variables)
✅ Do implement comprehensive testing
✅ Do configure dependency caching
✅ Do use multiple security scanning tools
✅ Do require approvals for production
✅ Do implement automated rollback
✅ Do monitor deployments
✅ Do test your pipeline on feature branches
✅ Do document deployment procedures
✅ Do regularly update pipeline actions/images

## Example Usage

```bash
# GitHub Actions with default settings
/setup-cicd "/path/to/project"

# GitLab CI
/setup-cicd "/path/to/project" "gitlab-ci"

# Jenkins
/setup-cicd "/path/to/project" "jenkins"

# Node.js project with GitHub Actions
/setup-cicd "/Users/dev/my-app" "github-actions"

# Python project with GitLab CI
/setup-cicd "/Users/dev/python-api" "gitlab-ci"
```

## Notes

- Pipeline configuration is project-specific and may need manual adjustments
- Security tool API tokens must be added as secrets manually
- First pipeline run may fail until secrets are configured
- Deployment targets must be configured separately (AWS credentials, Kubernetes config)
- Database integration tracks setup patterns for continuous improvement
- All quality gates must pass - no exceptions
- Caching significantly speeds up builds (5-10x faster)
- Health checks prevent broken deployments reaching production
- Rollback procedures are critical for production stability
