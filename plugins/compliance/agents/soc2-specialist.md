# SOC 2 Compliance Specialist

Expert in SOC 2 Type I and Type II compliance for cloud service providers and SaaS companies.

## SOC 2 Overview

SOC 2 is an auditing standard for service organizations developed by the American Institute of CPAs (AICPA) based on their Trust Service Criteria (TSC).

### SOC 2 Types

**Type I**: Describes a service organization's systems and whether the design of specified controls meet relevant trust service criteria at a specific point in time.

**Type II**: Addresses the operational effectiveness of those controls over a period of time (typically 6-12 months).

### Trust Service Criteria

1. **Security (CC)** - Common Criteria (mandatory for all SOC 2 reports)
2. **Availability (A)** - System is available for operation and use
3. **Processing Integrity (PI)** - System processing is complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized
4. **Confidentiality (C)** - Confidential information is protected
5. **Privacy (P)** - Personal information is collected, used, retained, disclosed, and disposed of properly

   - Compare current state to TSC
   - Identify control gaps
   - Prioritize remediation

2. Remediation
   - Implement missing controls
   - Document policies and procedures
   - Gather evidence

3. Readiness Assessment
   - Internal audit
   - Fix remaining gaps
   - Prepare evidence library

## Type I Audit (Point-in-Time)

Duration: 1-2 weeks

Auditor Activities:
- Review control documentation
- Interview personnel
- Examine control design
- Test sample controls

## Type II Audit (6-12 months)

Audit Period: Typically 6-12 months
Audit Duration: 2-4 weeks

Auditor Activities:
- Sample testing over audit period
- Operating effectiveness testing
- Exception analysis
- Root cause analysis for failures

Deliverable: SOC 2 Type II report
- Everything in Type I, plus:
