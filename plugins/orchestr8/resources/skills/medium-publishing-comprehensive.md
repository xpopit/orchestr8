# Medium Publishing Comprehensive Guide

## Medium Distribution Standards (2025)

### Critical Requirements
- **CTA Limit**: All calls-to-action must be under 20% of total content (critical for distribution!)
- **No Clickbait**: Headline must accurately represent content and maintain reader trust
- **Quality Threshold**: Content must be substantive and worthy of curation consideration
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain authentic voice while being appropriate for target publication
- **Engagement Ratio**: Optimize for high engagement-to-click ratios with honest headlines

### Medium's Algorithm Favors
1. **High Engagement-to-Click Ratios**: Honest headlines that deliver on promises
2. **Long Read Times**: Engaging, well-paced content that keeps readers on page
3. **Highlights and Comments**: Sticky lines and discussion-worthy points
4. **Shares and Bookmarks**: Actionable value that readers want to save
5. **Internal Engagement**: Responses within first 24 hours of publication

## Hero Image Requirements

### Image Specifications
- **Minimum Width**: 1400px wide (1600px+ recommended)
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 for optimal display
- **File Format**: PNG or JPG (PNG for graphics, JPG for photos)
- **File Size**: Under 5MB for fast loading
- **Alt Text**: Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility

### Hero Image Generation Options

#### Option 1: AI-Generated (DALL-E 3)
```python
# Requires OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
python scripts/generate-hero-image.py --file medium/[filename].md --method dalle --update
```

**Prompt formula for DALL-E:**
- "Minimalist [article theme] illustration, clean geometric shapes, [2-3 colors], professional, abstract, modern design"
- Example: "Minimalist programming concept illustration, clean geometric shapes, blue and orange gradient, professional, abstract, modern design"

#### Option 2: AI-Generated (Stable Diffusion)
```python
# Requires REPLICATE_API_TOKEN environment variable
python scripts/generate-hero-image.py --file medium/[filename].md --method replicate --update
```

#### Option 3: Gradient Fallback
```python
# No API required - generates CSS gradient as image
python scripts/generate-hero-image.py --file medium/[filename].md --method gradient --update
```

#### Option 4: Unsplash Search
Provide specific search terms based on article theme:
- Technical articles: "abstract [technology] minimal clean"
- Personal development: "sunrise journey path minimalist"
- Business: "professional workspace modern minimal"
- Creative: "artistic [topic] abstract colorful"

## Publishing Instructions Template

### Pre-Publication Checklist
- [ ] Review story for typos, flow, and readability
- [ ] Generate or select hero image (1400px+ wide, 16:9 ratio)
- [ ] Verify hero image renders correctly and matches theme
- [ ] Add section images at strategic locations (every 3-5 paragraphs)
- [ ] Verify all links work correctly and add value
- [ ] Confirm 3-5 tags are relevant and strategic for curation
- [ ] Read aloud to check pacing and engagement
- [ ] Verify CTA content is under 20% of total
- [ ] Check headline accurately represents content
- [ ] Ensure formatting follows Medium best practices

### Manual Publishing Process (Recommended)
1. Navigate to https://medium.com/new-story
2. Copy/paste content from markdown file
3. Add hero image immediately under title
4. Add section images at marked locations
5. Apply text formatting:
   - **Bold** for key takeaways and emphasis
   - *Italics* for subtle emphasis
   - Headers for H2 and H3 structure
   - Code blocks with syntax highlighting
6. Add 3-5 strategic tags in right sidebar
7. Choose publication if submitting (optional)
8. Save as draft initially
9. Review on both mobile and desktop
10. Publish when satisfied with all elements

### API Publishing (Legacy - Not Recommended)
**Note**: Medium's API is no longer actively maintained. Manual publishing strongly recommended for reliability and full feature access.

If you must use API:
```python
# Requires MEDIUM_INTEGRATION_TOKEN environment variable
# See medium-api-publishing skill for complete implementation
```

## Tag Strategy for Maximum Reach

### Tag Selection Framework
1. **Primary Tag** (Position 1): Main topic/category (e.g., "Programming", "Self Improvement")
2. **Secondary Tag** (Position 2): Specific technology or subtopic (e.g., "Python", "Productivity")
3. **Tertiary Tag** (Position 3): Methodology or approach (e.g., "Tutorial", "Beginners")
4. **Reach Tags** (Positions 4-5): Broader appeal terms (e.g., "Technology", "Life Lessons")

### High-Value Tag Categories
- **Technology**: Programming, JavaScript, Python, Web Development, AI
- **Career**: Career, Productivity, Leadership, Entrepreneurship
- **Personal Development**: Self Improvement, Life Lessons, Mindfulness, Mental Health
- **Business**: Startup, Business, Marketing, Design
- **Writing**: Writing, Creativity, Storytelling

### Tag Optimization Tips
- Research tag popularity on Medium's tag pages
- Check competitor articles for successful tag combinations
- Balance specificity (niche) with reach (popular)
- Use all 5 tag slots (don't waste opportunities)
- Avoid overly generic tags like "Life" or "Thoughts"

## Publication Submission Strategy

### Building Foundation First
1. Publish 3-5 solid articles on personal profile
2. Establish consistent voice and quality standard
3. Build small but engaged follower base
4. Demonstrate writing consistency (1 article/week)

### Researching Target Publications
**Top-tier publications by category:**

**Technology:**
- Better Programming (5M+ followers)
- The Startup (800K+ followers)
- JavaScript in Plain English (100K+ followers)
- Level Up Coding (40K+ followers)

**Personal Development:**
- Better Humans (150K+ followers)
- Personal Growth (100K+ followers)
- The Ascent (100K+ followers)

**Writing/Creativity:**
- The Writing Cooperative (100K+ followers)
- Creators Hub (50K+ followers)

### Submission Process
1. Read publication's submission guidelines (usually in About page)
2. Review recently published articles to understand style/quality
3. Choose your best work that matches publication's focus
4. Follow their submission process (typically "Add to publication" button)
5. Write brief pitch if requested (2-3 sentences on value)
6. Be patient (editors review many submissions)
7. Don't simultaneously submit to multiple publications

### Publication Benefits
- **Immediate Reach**: Access to built-in audience (10K-5M followers)
- **Curation Boost**: Higher likelihood of Medium curation
- **Credibility**: Association with established publications
- **Community**: Connection with other writers and editors
- **Learning**: Editorial feedback improves writing

## Post-Publication Distribution

### First 24 Hours (Critical Window)
1. **Respond to All Comments**: Engage within first hour if possible
2. **Share Strategically**:
   - Twitter: Thread with key takeaways + link
   - LinkedIn: Professional context + link (avoid just pasting article)
   - Relevant Slack/Discord communities (follow channel rules)
   - Hacker News (if technical and substantial)
3. **Cross-Post Consideration**:
   - Dev.to (for technical content)
   - Hashnode (for developer content)
   - Your own blog (use canonical URL to point to Medium)

### Ongoing Promotion (Week 1-4)
- **Day 3**: Share again with different angle/quote
- **Week 2**: Include in newsletter if you have one
- **Week 4**: Analyze metrics, identify what resonated
- **Month 2+**: Update article with new insights if topic stays relevant

### Strategic Sharing Guidelines
- **Don't**: Spam links in unrelated communities
- **Don't**: Share more than once per day on same platform
- **Don't**: Use "Link in bio" tactics (looks promotional)
- **Do**: Add context explaining why article is valuable
- **Do**: Participate in community before sharing
- **Do**: Share others' content too (not just your own)

## Timing and Cadence

### Optimal Publishing Times (US-Centric)
- **Best Days**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- **Best Times**:
  - Morning: 6-8 AM EST (before work commute)
  - Lunch: 12-1 PM EST (midday break)
  - Evening: 7-9 PM EST (after dinner)
- **Avoid**: Friday evenings, weekends (lower engagement)

### Publishing Cadence Strategy
- **Beginners**: 1 article per week (focus on quality)
- **Intermediate**: 2 articles per week (find sustainable rhythm)
- **Advanced**: 3+ per week (only if quality doesn't suffer)

**Key principle**: Consistency > Frequency. Better to publish 1 great article weekly than 3 mediocre ones.

### Batching for Consistency
1. **Research Phase**: Generate 10-15 topic ideas in one session
2. **Writing Phase**: Draft 2-3 articles back-to-back
3. **Editing Phase**: Polish multiple articles in focused sessions
4. **Publishing Phase**: Schedule releases for optimal times

## Content Format Optimization

### Markdown to Medium Translation
**Preserve these elements:**
- Header hierarchy (H2 → Large header, H3 → Small header)
- Bold and italic formatting
- Bullet lists and numbered lists
- Code blocks with language specification
- Block quotes for emphasis
- Hyperlinks (but verify they all work)

**Add manually in Medium editor:**
- Hero image positioning
- Section images between paragraphs
- Pull quotes (highlight text and select "T" icon)
- Dividers (three asterisks: ***)
- Embedded media (tweets, YouTube, etc.)

### Visual Break Strategy
- Add section image every 3-5 paragraphs
- Use pull quotes to highlight key insights
- Insert dividers between major sections
- Break up long sections with subheadings
- Use lists to create visual variety

## Metrics to Monitor

### Primary Metrics (Medium Stats)
- **Views**: Total article opens
- **Reads**: Users who read to end (most important)
- **Read Ratio**: Reads/Views (aim for 40%+)
- **Fans**: Users who clapped (engagement indicator)
- **Highlights**: Text selections (shows resonance)

### Success Benchmarks
- **New Writers**: 100+ views, 40+ reads, 30% read ratio
- **Established Writers**: 1K+ views, 400+ reads, 40% read ratio
- **Top Performers**: 10K+ views, 4K+ reads, 40%+ read ratio

### What to Learn From Metrics
- **Low Read Ratio** (<30%): Headline mismatch or weak opening
- **High Highlights**: Sticky lines working, create more
- **Low Fans**: Content not resonating emotionally
- **High Shares**: Actionable value, replicate approach
- **Quick Drop-off**: Improve pacing in that section

## Integration with Publications
