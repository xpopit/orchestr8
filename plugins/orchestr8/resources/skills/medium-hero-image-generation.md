# Medium Hero Image Generation

Automatically generate professional hero images for Medium articles using AI image generation tools and best practices.

## Overview

Hero images are critical for Medium articles - they appear in feeds, search results, and at the top of your story. A compelling hero image increases click-through rates by 40-60%.

## Medium Hero Image Requirements

### Technical Specifications
- **Minimum width**: 1400px (1920px recommended for retina displays)
- **Aspect ratio**: 2:1 or 16:9 (landscape preferred)
- **File format**: JPEG or PNG (WebP for modern browsers)
- **File size**: Under 5MB (2-3MB ideal for loading speed)
- **Resolution**: 72-150 DPI for web

### Design Principles
- Simple and clean: Avoid clutter, focus on one concept
- Abstract or conceptual: Visual metaphor over literal representation
- Professional: High-quality, polished aesthetic
- Readable thumbnails: Looks good at small sizes
- On-brand: Matches article tone (technical, personal, inspirational)

### Common Hero Image Styles

| Article Type | Visual Style | Example Concepts |
|-------------|--------------|------------------|
| Technical/Dev | Minimal, geometric, code-inspired | Abstract data flows, geometric patterns |
| Personal Growth | Inspirational, human-centric | Sunrise/paths, journey metaphors |
| Business/Career | Professional, modern | Office aesthetics, growth charts |
| Creative/Design | Artistic, vibrant | Color gradients, abstract art |
| Data/Analytics | Data visualization, clean | Charts, graphs, data patterns |

## AI Image Generation Tools

### Option 1: DALL-E 3 (OpenAI API)

**Best for:** Highest quality, photorealistic or artistic imagery

**Pros:**
- Excellent text understanding and prompt following
- Direct API integration
- Generates 1792x1024 (perfect for hero images)

**Cons:**
- Cost: ~$0.04-0.08 per image
- Requires OpenAI API key
- Content policy restrictions

**→ See full implementation:** @orchestr8://examples/medium/hero-image-generation-dalle

### Option 2: Stable Diffusion (Local or API)

**Best for:** Budget-friendly, high customization

**Pros:**
- Low cost ($0.002-0.005 via Replicate) or free locally
- Highly customizable
- No content restrictions

**Cons:**
- Requires GPU for local generation
- More complex prompt engineering
- Quality varies by model

**→ See full implementation:** @orchestr8://examples/medium/hero-image-generation-sd

### Option 3: Midjourney (Manual with Prompt Templates)

**Best for:** Highest artistic quality, abstract/conceptual imagery

**Pros:**
- Excellent for abstract imagery
- Great community and resources

**Cons:**
- No official API (manual generation)
- Subscription required ($10-60/month)

**Prompt Template:**
```
/imagine prompt: [article theme as visual concept],
professional minimal abstract photography,
clean modern aesthetic,
[specific visual elements],
landscape 16:9,
professional stock photo quality,
high detail,
sharp focus,
[color palette],
no text --ar 16:9 --v 6 --stylize 500
```

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices

### Anatomy of a Great Hero Image Prompt

```
[Core Concept] + [Visual Style] + [Technical Requirements] + [Mood/Aesthetic] + [Negative Constraints]
```

**Core Concept** (What to visualize):
- Transform abstract ideas into visual metaphors
- Example: "AI memory management" → "flowing data streams with selective filtering"
- Example: "Productivity" → "organized geometric pathways leading upward"

**Visual Style** (How it should look):
- "minimal modern abstract photography"
- "professional stock photo aesthetic"
- "clean geometric illustration"
- "cinematic lighting"

**Technical Requirements:**
- "landscape 16:9 aspect ratio"
- "high resolution, sharp focus"
- "suitable for thumbnails"
- "no text or typography"

**Mood/Aesthetic:**
- Professional: "clean, sophisticated, modern"
- Inspirational: "uplifting, hopeful, bright"
- Technical: "precise, analytical, structured"
- Creative: "vibrant, imaginative, dynamic"

**Negative Constraints** (What to avoid):
- "no text, no words, no letters"
- "not cluttered, not busy"
- "no watermarks, no signatures"
- "not low quality, not blurry"

### Example Prompts by Article Theme

**Technical/Developer Article:**
```
Abstract visualization of modular code architecture,
clean geometric shapes representing interconnected systems,
professional minimal style,
dark background with glowing blue connections,
sharp focus,
landscape 16:9,
modern tech aesthetic,
no text
```

**Personal Growth Article:**
```
Minimalist path or stairway leading upward into light,
clean professional photography,
inspirational mood,
soft lighting,
muted color palette with warm tones,
landscape 16:9,
sharp focus,
no text
```

**Productivity Article:**
```
Organized abstract workspace with geometric elements,
clean minimal design,
professional aesthetic,
focused lighting highlighting key areas,
blue and white color scheme,
landscape 16:9,
high quality,
no text
```

## Fallback Strategies

When AI generation is unavailable:

1. **Curated Stock Photos**: Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay (free, commercial-use)
2. **Simple Gradients**: Generate programmatically with PIL/Pillow
3. **Geometric Patterns**: Use Canva, Figma, or CSS art generators

**→ See fallback implementations:** @orchestr8://examples/medium/hero-image-fallback-strategies

## Integration with Medium Workflow

Add to Phase 4 of Medium story creation:

```markdown
### 4.5. Generate Hero Image

**→ Load:** @orchestr8://skills/medium-hero-image-generation

**Activities:**
- Extract article theme and tone from content
- Generate optimized prompt for AI image generation
- Create hero image using available tool (DALL-E, SD, or Midjourney)
- Save image to `medium/images/[article-slug]-hero.png`
- Update frontmatter with image path
- Add alt text for accessibility

**Update frontmatter:**
```yaml
hero_image: "medium/images/2025-11-11-article-title-hero.png"
hero_image_alt: "Abstract visualization of [key concept from article]"
```

## Quality Checklist

Before using a generated hero image:
- ✅ Width ≥ 1400px (1920px recommended)
- ✅ Aspect ratio 16:9 or 2:1 (landscape)
- ✅ File size < 5MB (2-3MB ideal)
- ✅ No text, watermarks, or signatures
- ✅ Clean, professional aesthetic
- ✅ Readable as thumbnail (test at 200px wide)
- ✅ Matches article tone and content
- ✅ High contrast for text overlay
- ✅ Alt text describes visual concept
- ✅ Saved with descriptive filename

## Cost Comparison

| Tool | Cost per Image | Quality | Automation | Setup |
|------|---------------|---------|------------|-------|
| DALL-E 3 | $0.04-0.08 | Excellent | Full | Low |
| SD (Replicate) | $0.002-0.005 | Very Good | Full | Low |
| SD (Local) | Free | Very Good | Full | High |
| Midjourney | ~$0.30-0.50* | Excellent | Partial | Medium |
| Unsplash | Free | Varies | Manual | None |
| Gradient | Free | Basic | Full | None |

*Based on subscription cost divided by typical monthly usage

## Best Practices

1. **Match Visual to Content**: Technical articles need clean, modern aesthetics; personal stories need warmth
2. **Test Readability**: View at thumbnail size (200x200px) to ensure visual clarity
3. **Consistent Style**: Maintain visual consistency across articles for brand recognition
4. **Alt Text**: Always include descriptive alt text for accessibility
5. **Iterate**: Generate 2-3 options, choose best, refine prompt for future use
6. **Archive Prompts**: Save successful prompts for reuse and iteration
7. **Preview in Context**: Place image in Medium draft to see how it looks with title overlay
8. **Optimize File Size**: Use TinyPNG or ImageOptim to reduce file size without quality loss

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

❌ **Too literal**: Don't just visualize keywords (e.g., "laptop" for tech article)
❌ **Too busy**: Complex images don't read well as thumbnails
❌ **Text in image**: Medium adds title overlay; text causes clutter
❌ **Wrong aspect ratio**: Portrait or square images don't work well
❌ **Low resolution**: Under 1400px looks pixelated on retina displays
❌ **Oversaturated colors**: Clashes with Medium's clean aesthetic
❌ **Stock photo clichés**: Avoid overused concepts (light bulbs for ideas, etc.)
