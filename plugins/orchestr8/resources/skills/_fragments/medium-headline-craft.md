# Medium Headline Crafting

Master the art of writing headlines that drive clicks while maintaining authenticity and trust.

## Core Principles

### Balance Curiosity and Clarity
- **Curiosity**: Create information gap that compels clicking
- **Clarity**: Accurately represent content to maintain trust
- **Balance**: Avoid clickbait while still being intriguing

✅ **Good:** "How I Built a $10K/Month Side Project (Without Code)"
- Curiosity: Specific result, counterintuitive method
- Clarity: You'll learn about building profitable side projects

❌ **Bad:** "You Won't Believe What Happened When I Tried This"
- Too vague, misleading, pure clickbait

### Headline Length Guidelines
- **Optimal**: 60-80 characters (full display in search/social)
- **Maximum**: 100 characters before truncation
- **Sweet spot**: 6-12 words

## Proven Headline Formulas

### Number-Based (Highest Performance)
```

```

## Psychological Triggers

### Specificity Wins
❌ Generic: "How to Make Money Online"
✅ Specific: "How I Made $5,247 in My First Month of Freelance Writing"

**Why it works**: Specificity builds credibility and sets clear expectations

### Time-Bound Promise
❌ Vague: "Learn Python Programming"
✅ Time-bound: "Learn Python in 30 Days (Complete Beginner's Roadmap)"

**Why it works**: Defines commitment and makes goal achievable

### Obstacle Removal
❌ Standard: "How to Start Investing"
✅ Obstacle-removed: "How to Start Investing With Just $100 (No Experience Needed)"

**Why it works**: Addresses common blockers and lowers barriers

### Personal Proof
❌ Abstract: "Productivity Tips That Work"
✅ Proof-based: "I Tried 50 Productivity Hacks. These 7 Actually Changed My Life."

**Why it works**: Real results from real person builds trust

## Medium-Specific Optimization

### Curation-Friendly Patterns
Medium curators look for:
- Clear topic and benefit
- Professional tone (not sensational)
- Specific value proposition
- Appropriate for target tag category

✅ **Curation-friendly:**
"Understanding React Hooks: A Practical Guide for Beginners"

❌ **Curation-unfriendly:**
"This One React Trick Will BLOW YOUR MIND!!!"

### Social Sharing Optimization
For Twitter/LinkedIn sharing:
- Front-load key benefit (first 60 chars)
- Include specific metric or number
- Use parentheses for context

Example: "How to Land Your First Dev Job (7 Steps That Actually Work)"

## A/B Testing Framework

### Generate Multiple Variations
For topic "Getting started with meditation":

**Variation 1 (Number)**: "7 Meditation Techniques That Changed My Life (Complete Beginner's Guide)"

**Variation 2 (How-to)**: "How to Start Meditating When You Have a Busy Mind"

**Variation 3 (Personal)**: "I Meditated Every Day for 100 Days. Here's What Happened."

**Variation 4 (Contrarian)**: "Why Traditional Meditation Advice Fails (And What Works Instead)"

### Test and Iterate
- Publish with strongest headline
- Monitor engagement in first 24 hours
- Note patterns in high-performing headlines
- Apply learnings to future articles

## Common Mistakes

### Over-Promise
❌ "Learn Everything About Machine Learning in One Weekend"
- Unrealistic, damages credibility

### Vagueness
❌ "Some Thoughts on Personal Growth"
- No clear benefit, no curiosity hook

### Excessive Capitalization/Punctuation
❌ "This AMAZING Trick Will CHANGE Your Life!!!"
- Looks spammy, damages professionalism

### Keyword Stuffing
❌ "Python Programming Python Tutorial Learn Python Python for Beginners"
- Poor readability, looks desperate

### Misleading Clickbait
❌ "You Won't Believe What Happened Next"
- Violates Medium distribution standards, damages trust

## Headline Checklist

Before publishing, verify:
- ✅ Is the benefit clear?
- ✅ Is there a curiosity hook?
- ✅ Is it specific (numbers, timeframes, metrics)?
- ✅ Does it accurately represent the content?
- ✅ Is it under 80 characters?
- ✅ Does it avoid excessive punctuation/caps?
- ✅ Would I click it if I saw it in my feed?
- ✅ Does it maintain professional tone?
