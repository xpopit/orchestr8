## PR Review Best Practices

```bash
# Check out PR locally for testing
gh pr checkout 123

# Review changes with detailed diff
git diff main...feature-branch

# Add review comments
gh pr review 123 --comment --body "Great work! Few suggestions..."

# Request changes
gh pr review 123 --request-changes --body "Please address memory leak in line 45"

# Approve PR
gh pr review 123 --approve --body "LGTM! ✅"

# Add inline comments via web UI for specific code lines

# Re-request review after updates
gh pr ready 123  # Mark draft as ready
```

## Handling PR Updates

```bash
# Updating PR with new commits
git checkout feature-branch
# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "fix: address review comments"
git push origin feature-branch

# Squashing commits before merge
git rebase -i main  # Interactive rebase
# Mark commits as 'squash' or 'fixup'
git push --force-with-lease origin feature-branch

# Syncing PR branch with latest main
git checkout feature-branch
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main  # Or merge if team prefers
git push --force-with-lease origin feature-branch

# Resolving conflicts during PR
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
# Fix conflicts
git add .
git rebase --continue
git push --force-with-lease origin feature-branch
```

## PR Merge Strategies

```bash
# Merge commit (preserves all commits and history)
gh pr merge 123 --merge --delete-branch

# Squash merge (combines all commits into one)
gh pr merge 123 --squash --delete-branch \
  --body "Squashed commit message with full context"

# Rebase merge (replays commits on top of main)
gh pr merge 123 --rebase --delete-branch

# Auto-merge when checks pass
gh pr merge 123 --auto --squash --delete-branch
```

## Stacked/Dependent PRs

```bash
# Create PR chain for large features
git checkout -b feature/step1-database-schema
# ... make changes ...
git push -u origin feature/step1-database-schema
gh pr create --base main --title "Step 1: Database schema"

git checkout -b feature/step2-api-endpoints
# ... make changes ...
git push -u origin feature/step2-api-endpoints
gh pr create --base feature/step1-database-schema --title "Step 2: API endpoints"

git checkout -b feature/step3-frontend
# ... make changes ...
git push -u origin feature/step3-frontend
gh pr create --base feature/step2-api-endpoints --title "Step 3: Frontend UI"

# Update base after merge
gh pr edit 456 --base main  # Update step2 to target main after step1 merges
```
