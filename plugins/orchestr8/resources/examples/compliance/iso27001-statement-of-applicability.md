## Usage Notes

- Update SoA whenever controls change
- Review annually during management review
- Map SoA controls to risk treatment plan
- Document all implementation decisions
- Include SoA in Stage 1 audit documentation
- Ensure evidence available for all "Implemented" controls
- Track remediation timeline for non-implemented controls
- Justify all "Not Applicable" decisions clearly
- Link controls to policies and procedures
- Use SoA as checklist for internal audits
