# Microservices Transformation - Detailed Roadmap Template

Complete implementation roadmap template with phased plan, service priorities, and transformation approaches.

## Good/Better/Best Transformation Approaches

### GOOD: Gradual Extraction (Strangler Fig)

**Approach**: Extract one service at a time
**Pattern**: Monolith remains, services extracted gradually
**Timeline**: 6-12 months
**Risk**: Low (incremental, reversible)
**Complexity**: Moderate (maintain both systems)

**Pros:**
- Low risk, incremental value
- Learn and adjust as you go
- No big-bang cutover
- Monolith shrinks over time

**Cons:**
- Longer timeline
- Maintain both architectures
- Data migration complexity
- Potential for tech debt in transition state

### BETTER: Parallel Implementation

**Approach**: Build new microservices, run parallel, cutover
**Pattern**: New system built alongside old
**Timeline**: 8-14 months
**Risk**: Moderate (parallel systems, larger cutover)
**Complexity**: High (two systems running)

**Pros:**
- Clean break from monolith
- Can redesign without constraints
- Controlled cutover
- Fallback to monolith if needed

**Cons:**
- Higher cost (running both)
- Data synchronization complexity
- Larger cutover event
- Potential for drift

### BEST: Complete Rewrite

**Approach**: Build microservices from scratch, big-bang cutover
**Pattern**: Greenfield microservices system
**Timeline**: 10-18 months
**Risk**: High (all-at-once cutover)
**Complexity**: Very high (entire system)

**Pros:**
- Clean architecture, no baggage
- Modern tech stack throughout
- Optimal service boundaries
- No migration complexity during build

**Cons:**
- Longest timeline
- Highest risk (big-bang)
- Business feature parity needed
- Potential to miss requirements

## Strangler Fig Pattern (Recommended)

### Phase 1: API Gateway Introduction
- Add API Gateway in front of monolith
- All requests route through gateway
- No functional changes yet

### Phase 2: Extract First Service (Pilot)
- Choose low-risk, low-dependency service
- Build as microservice
- Route specific requests to new service
- Monolith handles rest

### Phase 3: Extract Core Services
- User Management
- Product Catalog
- Order Processing
- Each extraction:
  1. Build service
  2. Migrate data
  3. Update gateway routing
  4. Decommission from monolith

### Phase 4: Extract Remaining Services
- Continue until monolith is empty
- Eventually decommission monolith

## Service Extraction Priority

### Priority 1: Foundation Services
**Why first**: Required infrastructure for all services
- Authentication/Authorization
- API Gateway
- Configuration Service
- Logging/Monitoring

### Priority 2: Pilot Service
**Why first**: Prove patterns and processes
**Characteristics:**
- Low risk
- Low dependencies
- Not business-critical
**Examples:**
- Notification Service
- Reporting Service
- File Upload Service

### Priority 3: Core Business Services
**Why next**: High value, moderate dependencies
- User Management
- Product Catalog
- Order Processing

### Priority 4: Dependent Services
**Why next**: Services that depend on Priority 3
- Payment Processing
- Inventory Management
- Shipping

### Priority 5: Remaining Services
**Why last**: Lower priority capabilities
- Admin tools
- Analytics
- Background jobs

## Phased Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 0: Foundation & Pilot (8 weeks)

**Services:**
- API Gateway setup
- Authentication Service (extraction)
- Monitoring infrastructure
- Pilot Service (low-risk extraction)

**Goals:**
- Prove strangler fig pattern
- Establish service patterns
- Set up tooling and processes

**Deliverables:**
- API Gateway operational
- First service extracted
- CI/CD pipeline established
- Monitoring dashboards created

**Exit Criteria:**
- Pilot service handles 100% of its traffic
- Zero production incidents from new services
- Team comfortable with new patterns

### Phase 1: Core Services Extraction (12 weeks)

**Services:**
- User Management Service
- Product Catalog Service
- Order Processing Service

**Goals:**
- Extract core business capabilities
- Establish data migration patterns
- Validate communication patterns

**Deliverables:**
- Core services running in production
- Data migration validated
- Event-driven patterns operational

**Exit Criteria:**
- All core services handle production traffic
- Data consistency validated
- Performance meets SLAs

### Phase 2: Dependent Services (10 weeks)

**Services:**
- Payment Service
- Inventory Service
- Shipping Service

**Goals:**
- Complete business capability extraction
- Reduce monolith to minimal functionality

**Deliverables:**
- All business services extracted
- Monolith handles only legacy features

**Exit Criteria:**
- 80% of traffic goes to microservices
- Monolith only serves legacy features
- No critical dependencies on monolith

### Phase 3: Remaining Services & Decommission (6 weeks)

**Services:**
- Admin Services
- Reporting Services
- Background Jobs

**Goals:**
- Complete extraction
- Decommission monolith

**Deliverables:**
- Monolith decommissioned
- Full microservices architecture operational

**Exit Criteria:**
- 100% traffic to microservices
- Monolith shut down
- All data migrated

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Platform
- **Container Orchestration**: Kubernetes, ECS, GKE
- **Service Mesh**: Istio, Linkerd (optional)
- **API Gateway**: Kong, Apigee, Azure API Management

### Data
- **Database per Service**: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
- **Message Queue**: RabbitMQ, Kafka, Azure Service Bus
- **Cache**: Redis

### Observability
- **Centralized Logging**: ELK, Splunk
- **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger, Zipkin, Application Insights
- **Metrics**: Prometheus, Grafana, CloudWatch

### CI/CD
- **Per-Service Pipelines**: GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, contract tests
- **Deployment**: Blue-green or canary deployments

## Team Organization

### Platform Team
**Responsibilities:**
- API Gateway
- Service Mesh
- Monitoring/Logging
- CI/CD infrastructure

**Size**: 3-5 engineers

### Service Teams (per domain)
**Responsibilities:**
- Own services in their domain
- End-to-end ownership (dev, deploy, operate)

**Example**: "Order Team" owns Order Service, Payment Service
**Size**: 4-6 engineers per team

### Cross-Functional
**Architecture Review Board:**
- Review service boundaries
- Ensure consistency
- Approve major changes

**Size**: 3-4 architects (part-time)

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous (REST, gRPC)
**Use for**: Read queries, immediate responses
**Pattern**: Service A calls Service B directly
**Pros**: Simple, immediate consistency
**Cons**: Coupling, cascading failures

**Examples:**
- Product Service → Inventory Service (check stock)
- Order Service → User Service (validate user)

### Asynchronous (Events, Message Queues)
**Use for**: Updates, eventual consistency OK
**Pattern**: Service A publishes event, Service B subscribes
**Pros**: Loose coupling, resilience
**Cons**: Eventual consistency, complexity

**Examples:**
- Order Service publishes OrderCreated event
- Inventory Service subscribes and reserves stock
- Shipping Service subscribes and schedules delivery

### Hybrid (Recommended)
- Synchronous for queries
- Asynchronous for commands/updates

**Example:**
- Order Service queries Product Service (sync)
- Order Service publishes OrderCreated event (async)

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### API Gateway
- Request routing
- Rate limiting
- Authentication/Authorization
- API versioning

### Service Mesh (Optional)
- Service-to-service auth (mTLS)
- Observability
- Traffic management
- Circuit breaking

### Centralized Logging
- Structured logs from all services
- Correlation IDs for tracing
- Log aggregation

### Distributed Tracing
- Request tracing across services
- Performance profiling
- Dependency mapping

## Timeline Example

```
Month 1-2:   Foundation & Pilot
Month 3-5:   Core Services (User, Product, Order)
Month 6-7:   Dependent Services (Payment, Inventory)
Month 8:     Remaining Services & Decommission
```

Total: 8 months for full transformation (Strangler Fig approach)

## Success Metrics

- **Service Coverage**: % of features extracted
- **Traffic Distribution**: % of requests to microservices
- **Performance**: Response time improvement
- **Reliability**: Uptime and error rates
- **Team Velocity**: Story points per sprint
- **Technical Debt**: Reduction in code complexity
