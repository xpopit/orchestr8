# Cloud Migration Planning - Detailed Implementation Guide

Complete templates and detailed guidance for cloud migration planning with HA/DR strategies and cost analysis.

## Migration Approaches Comparison

### GOOD: Lift-and-Shift (Minimum Viable)

**Approach**: Rehost applications with minimal changes
**Timeline**: 2-3 months
**Cost**: Lower initial, higher operational
**Risk**: Low (minimal changes)

**What it means:**
- Move VMs to cloud VMs (IaaS)
- Keep existing architecture
- Minimal code changes
- Quick datacenter exit

**Pros:**
- Fastest migration
- Lowest upfront cost
- Minimal risk
- Immediate cloud benefits (security, backups)

**Cons:**
- Higher long-term costs (paying for inefficient architecture)
- Doesn't leverage cloud-native features
- Limited scalability improvements
- Technical debt remains

**Use case**: Datacenter contract expiring, need quick migration

### BETTER: Containerize & Re-architecture (Recommended)

**Approach**: Modernize with containers and managed services
**Timeline**: 4-6 months
**Cost**: Balanced initial and operational
**Risk**: Moderate (architecture changes)

**What it means:**
- Containerize applications (Docker + Kubernetes)
- Use managed services (databases, caching, queues)
- Refactor for cloud patterns
- Implement auto-scaling

**Pros:**
- Balanced cost and benefit
- Cloud-native advantages
- Better scalability and resilience
- Reduced operational burden

**Cons:**
- Longer timeline than lift-and-shift
- Requires refactoring effort
- Team training needed
- Some application changes required

**Use case**: Most enterprises seeking modernization

### BEST: Full Microservices (Future-Proof)

**Approach**: Complete transformation to microservices
**Timeline**: 8-12 months
**Cost**: Higher initial, lower long-term
**Risk**: High (complete re-architecture)

**What it means:**
- Decompose to microservices
- Event-driven architecture
- Full cloud-native patterns
- Service mesh, auto-scaling, serverless

**Pros:**
- Optimal cloud utilization
- Maximum scalability
- Independent service deployment
- Lowest long-term costs

**Cons:**
- Longest timeline
- Highest upfront investment
- Requires significant expertise
- Operational complexity

**Use case**: Strategic transformation, greenfield opportunity

## HA/DR Strategy Details

### Backup/Restore
**RTO**: 4-24 hours
**RPO**: 1-24 hours
**Cost**: ~10% of primary infrastructure
**Architecture**: Backups only, no standby infrastructure

**Implementation:**
- Automated daily backups
- Backup retention policy (30 days)
- Recovery runbook documented
- Quarterly recovery drills

**Use case**: Non-critical systems (dev/test environments)

### Pilot Light
**RTO**: 1-4 hours
**RPO**: 15 minutes - 1 hour
**Cost**: ~20-30% of primary
**Architecture**: Minimal standby (database replication)

**Implementation:**
- Database continuously replicated to DR region
- Application servers stopped (but configured)
- Recovery: Start servers, switch DNS
- Monthly recovery drills

**Use case**: Moderate criticality systems

### Warm Standby
**RTO**: 15-60 minutes
**RPO**: 5-15 minutes
**Cost**: ~50-70% of primary
**Architecture**: Scaled-down replica running

**Implementation:**
- Full stack running at reduced capacity
- Database replication (near real-time)
- Recovery: Scale up DR, switch traffic
- Quarterly recovery drills

**Use case**: Business-critical systems

### Hot Standby / Active-Active
**RTO**: <5 minutes
**RPO**: Near-zero (seconds)
**Cost**: 100%+ of primary (duplicate infrastructure)
**Architecture**: Full duplicate, active traffic routing

**Implementation:**
- Full production environment in both regions
- Active-active database replication
- Traffic distributed via geo-load balancer
- Automatic failover

**Use case**: Mission-critical systems (e-commerce, financial)
