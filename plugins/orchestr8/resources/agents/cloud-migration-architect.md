   ```

**Output:** Target architecture (compute, data, networking, security layers with specific Azure/AWS/GCP services)

### Phase 3: HA/DR Strategy Design (40-60%)

**Objective:** Design high availability and disaster recovery strategy

**Activities:**

1. **High Availability Design**
   ```
   Implement:
   - Multi-zone deployment (within region)
   - Load balancing across zones
   - Database replication (sync within region)
   - Health checks and auto-healing
   - Circuit breakers for fault isolation
   - Retry policies with exponential backoff
   ```

2. **Disaster Recovery Design**
   ```
   Strategy options:
   
   - Backup/Restore (lowest cost, highest RTO/RPO)
     RTO: 4-24 hours
     RPO: 1-24 hours
     Cost: ~10% of primary
     
   - Pilot Light (minimal resources, moderate RTO/RPO)
     RTO: 1-4 hours
     RPO: 15 minutes - 1 hour
     Cost: ~20-30% of primary
     
   - Warm Standby (scaled-down replica, low RTO/RPO)
     RTO: 15-60 minutes
     RPO: 5-15 minutes
     Cost: ~50-70% of primary
     
   - Hot Standby/Active-Active (full replica, minimal RTO/RPO)
     RTO: < 5 minutes (automatic failover)
     RPO: Near-zero (sync replication)
     Cost: 100%+ of primary
   ```

3. **Failover Procedures**
   ```
   Define:
   - Automatic vs manual failover triggers
   - Failover sequence (DNS → Load Balancer → Database → Services)
   - Data consistency checks
   - Failback procedures
   - Testing schedule (quarterly DR drills)
   ```

**Output:** HA/DR strategy (availability zones, replication modes, failover procedures, testing schedule)

### Phase 4: Migration Strategy Design (60-80%)

   - Storage (databases, object storage, caching)
   - Networking (load balancers, data transfer, CDN)
   - Security (WAF, DDoS protection, secrets management)
   - Operations (monitoring, logging, backup)
   - Licenses (bring-your-own vs pay-as-you-go)
   - Reserved instances discounts
   ```

3. **Migration Costs**
   ```
   One-time:
   - Professional services
   - Application refactoring
   - Team training
   - Testing and validation
   - Migration tooling
   - Parallel run period
   ```

4. **TCO Comparison**
   ```
   Compare 3-year TCO:
   - On-premises baseline

   ```

**Output:** TCO analysis (current state vs cloud costs, 3-year comparison, ROI with payback period)

### Phase 6: Implementation Roadmap (95-100%)

**Objective:** Create phased implementation plan

**Output:** Phased implementation roadmap (Foundation → Core → Secondary → DR/Cutover)

## Integration with Workflows

### Cloud Migration Planning Workflow

## Best Practices

✅ **Requirements first** - Understand availability, RPO/RTO before designing
✅ **Multi-tier options** - Always provide good/better/best choices
✅ **Cost transparency** - Clear TCO with all costs included
✅ **Realistic timelines** - Account for learning curves and testing
✅ **Phased approach** - Pilot → Core → Full migration
✅ **Test DR regularly** - Quarterly DR drills minimum
✅ **Monitor continuously** - Observability from day one
✅ **Document everything** - Architecture decisions, runbooks, procedures

❌ **Don't over-architect** - Start with "Better", not always "Best"
❌ **Don't ignore costs** - Reserved instances, right-sizing matter
❌ **Don't skip DR testing** - Untested DR plans don't work
❌ **Don't forget compliance** - HIPAA, SOC2 requirements from start
