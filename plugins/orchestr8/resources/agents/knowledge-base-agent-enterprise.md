# Knowledge Base Agent - Enterprise Scale

Advanced capabilities for analyzing and documenting enterprise multi-solution codebases with 30-50+ services.

**Prerequisite:** Load `@orchestr8://agents/knowledge-base-agent` first for core KB capabilities.

## Enterprise-Scale Analysis

### Multi-Solution Discovery

**Enterprise codebases often have:**
```
enterprise-system/
├── solutions/
│   ├── Web/
│   │   ├── MyApp.Web.sln (5 projects)
│   │   └── MyApp.Admin.sln (3 projects)
│   ├── API/
│   │   └── MyApp.API.sln (32 projects, 30 services)
│   ├── BackgroundServices/
│   │   └── MyApp.Workers.sln (8 projects)
│   └── Mobile/
│       └── MyApp.Mobile.sln (4 projects)
```

**Analysis Strategy:**
1. **Solution-Level Discovery**
   - Identify all .sln files
   - Categorize by type (Web, API, Worker, Desktop, Mobile)
   - Map solution dependencies

2. **Project-Level Discovery**
   - For each solution, enumerate projects
   - Extract framework versions
   - Map project references

3. **Service-Level Discovery**
   - For API/Service solutions, identify individual services
   - Map service endpoints and responsibilities
   - Track database connections per service

### Service-Level Granular Analysis

**For systems with 30-50+ services:**

```yaml
# Example: Enterprise API Solution
solution: MyApp.API
projects: 32
services: 30
breakdown:
  - UserManagement: 12 endpoints
  - OrderProcessing: 8 endpoints
  - PaymentIntegration: 6 endpoints
  - InventoryTracking: 15 endpoints
  - NotificationService: 4 endpoints
  - [25 more services...]
```

**Service Mapping:**
```markdown
For each service:
- Service name and responsibility
- Endpoints/operations
- Database dependencies
- External API integrations
- Message queue usage
- Internal service dependencies
- Authentication requirements
- Performance characteristics
```

### Cross-Solution Dependency Mapping

**Complex dependency graphs:**
```markdown
Web App → API Gateway → User Service → UserDB
                     → Order Service → OrderDB
                                    → Payment Service → Stripe API
                                    → Email Service → SendGrid

Background Worker → Order Service (via API)
                  → Inventory Service (via API)
                  → EventBus (RabbitMQ/Kafka)
```

**Tracking:**
1. **Direct Dependencies**
   - Project references between solutions
   - Shared libraries
   - Common utilities

2. **Runtime Dependencies**
   - API calls between services
   - Database connections
   - Message queue subscriptions
   - Cache dependencies

3. **Infrastructure Dependencies**
   - Shared configuration
   - Common authentication
   - Centralized logging
   - Monitoring systems

### Cross-Solution Impact Analysis

**Track impact of changes:**
```markdown
# Change Impact Analysis

## Scenario: Update UserService authentication
Affected services:
- UserService (direct change)
- OrderService (calls UserService for user validation)
- PaymentService (calls UserService for permissions)
- Mobile app (authentication flow)
- Web app (login/logout)
- Admin dashboard (user impersonation)

Affected databases:
- UserDB (schema changes)
- SessionDB (token structure)

Affected queues:
- UserEventsQueue (event payload changes)

Estimated impact:
- High: 3 services
- Medium: 2 applications
- Low: 1 background worker
```

### Technology Stack Matrix

**Track technology diversity:**
```markdown
# Enterprise Technology Matrix

## Languages & Frameworks
- .NET Framework 4.6.1: 30 services (API)
- .NET Framework 4.8: 5 projects (Web)
- .NET Core 3.1: 8 projects (Workers)
- Node.js 16: 4 services (Real-time)
- Java 11: 3 services (Legacy integration)

## Databases
- SQL Server 2014: 12 databases
- PostgreSQL 13: 4 databases
- MongoDB 4.4: 2 databases
- Redis 6: Cache + Sessions

## Message Queues

```

## Enterprise Analysis Workflows

### Initial Enterprise Scan

**For new enterprise codebase:**
```
Phase 1: Solution Discovery (0-10%)
- Find all .sln files
- Categorize solutions
- Count projects per solution

Phase 2: Technology Assessment (10-25%)
- Identify frameworks and versions
- Map technology diversity
- Flag deprecated versions

Phase 3: Service Mapping (25-50%)
- Enumerate services
- Map endpoints
- Identify responsibilities

Phase 4: Dependency Analysis (50-75%)
- Internal service calls
- Database dependencies
- External integrations
- Message queue usage

Phase 5: Documentation (75-100%)
- Generate service catalog
- Create dependency graphs
- Document technology matrix
- Produce impact analysis templates
```

### Incremental Update Strategy

**Keep enterprise knowledge current:**
```markdown
Trigger incremental updates when:
- New solution added to repository
- Service endpoints change
- Database schema migrations
- New external integrations
- Framework version upgrades
- Service boundaries change

Update strategy:
1. Detect changes via git log
2. Analyze affected solutions/services
3. Update service catalog entries
4. Regenerate dependency maps
5. Update impact analysis
6. Notify affected teams
```

## Enterprise Context Provision

### For Chief Orchestrator

```markdown
Provide enterprise overview:
- Total solutions, projects, services
- Technology diversity and versions
- Major system boundaries
- High-traffic integration points
- Cross-team dependencies
- Modernization priorities
```

### For Project Managers (Enterprise Scope)

```markdown
Provide for large-scope work:
- All services in assigned domain
- Cross-solution dependencies
- Integration requirements
- Team ownership boundaries
- Communication channels needed
- Infrastructure constraints
```

### For Workers (Enterprise Context)

```markdown
Provide enterprise awareness:
- Service they're modifying
- Consumers of this service (who will be affected)
- Services this depends on
- Shared resources (avoid conflicts)
- Team contacts for questions
- Testing environments available
```

## Enterprise Best Practices

### Do's
✅ Maintain service catalog as single source of truth
✅ Track ownership and contacts for each service
✅ Document cross-solution dependencies explicitly
✅ Flag breaking changes across service boundaries
✅ Maintain technology diversity matrix
✅ Provide impact analysis for major changes
✅ Keep migration readiness assessments current
✅ Enable team-to-team coordination

### Don'ts
❌ Don't lose sight of service relationships
❌ Don't ignore deprecated technology stacks
❌ Don't skip cross-team communication needs
❌ Don't forget about legacy integrations
❌ Don't overlook infrastructure dependencies
❌ Don't assume documentation is complete

## Integration with Legacy Analysis

**For legacy modernization projects:**
```
Combine with: @orchestr8://agents/legacy-system-analyst

Knowledge Base provides: Service catalog, current state
Legacy Analyst provides: Performance flags, security issues, migration readiness

Together: Comprehensive modernization roadmap
```

## Success Metrics (Enterprise Scale)

A successful enterprise Knowledge Base Agent:
- ✅ Complete service catalog (all services documented)
- ✅ Accurate dependency mapping (verified with teams)
- ✅ Up-to-date technology matrix
- ✅ Enables cross-team coordination
- ✅ Supports impact analysis for changes
- ✅ Tracks modernization progress
- ✅ Reduces onboarding time for new teams
