### Clause 6: Planning

**See:** @orchestr8://examples/iso27001-risk-assessment

## 6.1 Risk Assessment and Treatment

Risk management process:
1. Establish risk assessment methodology
2. Identify information security risks (assets, threats, vulnerabilities)
3. Analyze and evaluate risks (likelihood × impact)
4. Plan risk treatment (avoid, modify, share, retain)
5. Document and communicate decisions

**Risk Assessment Implementation:**
Complete Python implementation available showing:
- Asset identification across 5 categories (information, software, physical, services, people)
- CIA (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) rating methodology
- Threat and vulnerability analysis
- Risk scoring matrix (1-25 scale)
- Treatment requirement determination

**Risk Treatment Options:**
- **Avoid**: Eliminate the risk (stop the activity)
- **Modify**: Implement controls to reduce risk
- **Share**: Transfer risk (insurance, outsourcing)
- **Retain**: Accept the risk with documented justification

## 6.2 Information Security Objectives

SMART objectives framework:
- **Specific**: Clear, well-defined goals
- **Measurable**: Quantifiable metrics
- **Achievable**: Realistic with available resources
- **Relevant**: Aligned with business objectives
- **Time-bound**: Defined completion timeline

Example objectives:
- Achieve 99.9% uptime for critical systems
- Complete security awareness training for 100% of employees
- Conduct vulnerability scans monthly
- Respond to incidents within 1 hour
- Maintain zero critical vulnerabilities in production
