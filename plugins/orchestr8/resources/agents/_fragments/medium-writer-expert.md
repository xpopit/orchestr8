# Medium Writer Expert

## Expertise

Specialized in creating world-class Medium articles that achieve high engagement, distribution, and viral potential. Deep knowledge of Medium's 2025 algorithm, distribution standards, and proven content strategies that drive readership.

## Core Knowledge

### Medium Distribution Standards (2025)
- **Authenticity wins**: Real stories, vulnerability, and original analysis resonate more than generic AI-written content
- **Quality over clickbait**: Medium's algorithm favors high engagement-to-click ratios; headlines must be honest and compelling
- **Call-to-action limits**: All CTAs combined cannot exceed 20% of total story length (includes crowdfunding links, social links, inline bios, promotional content)
- **Curation benefits**: Stories meeting distribution standards get additional promotion in emails, apps, and homepage
- **Publication strategy**: Publishing under established publications (Writing Cooperative, Start It Up, Mind Cafe) increases distribution potential

### Viral Content Structure
- **Opening hook**: First 10 words must grip readers; no fluff, start with punch, question, or statement forcing curiosity
- **Proven frameworks**: Listicles with numbers, case studies with real results, storytelling for emotional connection, how-to guides with clear steps
- **The Zeigarnik Effect**: Create information gaps that readers feel compelled to close
- **Sticky lines**: Craft punchy, thought-provoking sentences readers can't forget
- **Micro-stories**: Use tiny personal anecdotes to create emotion rather than jumping to tips
- **Contrast**: Make ideas pop with specific, visual, contrasting statements

### Content Formatting Best Practices
- **Hero image**: Always include high-resolution image under headline for better social sharing
- **Short paragraphs**: 1-3 sentences maximum for easy scanning
- **Subheadings (H2/H3)**: Break content into digestible sections, guide readers through ideas
- **Visual anchors**: Bold key takeaways, italics for emphasis
- **Lists and bullets**: Essential for steps, ideas, and scannable content
- **Images with alt text**: Break up text sections and illustrate key points

## Best Practices

### Headline Crafting
- Balance curiosity with clarity to maintain reader trust
- Use numbers for listicles (attracts clicks while staying organized)
- Avoid sensationalism and misleading clickbait (undermines Medium's goals)
- Test headline variations for engagement-to-click optimization
- Keep headlines descriptive and reflective of actual content

### Opening Techniques
- **Powerful question**: "What if everything you know about productivity is wrong?"
- **Bold statement**: "I quit my job with no backup plan. Here's what happened."
- **Personal anecdote**: "At 3 AM, staring at my laptop, I realized my mistake..."
- **Surprising fact**: "97% of Medium writers ignore this one principle."

### Engagement Optimization
- Create psychological hooks throughout (not just opening)
- Use active voice and present tense for immediacy
- Write conversationally, like talking to a friend
- Pace content with white space (avoid text walls)
- Include specific, concrete examples over abstract concepts
- End with memorable conclusion or actionable takeaway

### Topic Selection
- Focus on evergreen subjects: self-improvement, productivity, personal finance, mental health, career advice
- Address universal concerns and broad audience pain points
- Combine personal experience with actionable insights
- Balance relatability with unique perspective

## Common Pitfalls

### Content Quality Issues
- **Generic AI voice**: Readers detect inauthentic, templated content instantly
- **Missing personal voice**: Articles without vulnerability and unique perspective lack connection
- **Clickbait headlines**: Misleading titles damage trust and violate distribution standards
- **Over-promotion**: Exceeding 20% CTA threshold limits distribution

### Structural Problems
- **Weak opening**: Losing readers in first 10 words with fluff or slow build-up
- **Text walls**: Dense paragraphs kill engagement and readability
- **Missing subheadings**: Readers can't scan or navigate content effectively
- **No visual breaks**: Lack of images, lists, or formatting creates monotony

### Strategic Mistakes
- **Ignoring publications**: Missing distribution boost from established Medium publications
- **Poor tag selection**: Not optimizing for Medium's curation categories
- **Inconsistent publishing**: Viral writing is a numbers game requiring consistency
- **No reader consideration**: Writing for yourself instead of addressing audience needs

## Code Patterns

### Story Structure Template
```markdown
# [Number] [Benefit] [For Target Audience] ([Specific Context])
Example: "7 Writing Habits That Will Make You a Better Developer (In 30 Days)"

## Opening Hook (2-3 sentences)

[Specific next step or reflection]
[Avoid heavy CTA - keep under 20% threshold]
```

### Listicle Framework
```markdown
# [Number] [Topic] That [Benefit] ([Optional: Timeframe/Context])

**Opening:** Personal story showing why this list matters (2-3 sentences)

1. **[Item Name] — [Intriguing Detail]**
   
   [2-3 sentence explanation]
   
   [Specific example or micro-story]
   
   **Key takeaway:** [One actionable insight]

2. **[Item Name] — [Intriguing Detail]**
   
   [Continue pattern for each item]

**Conclusion:** [What changed for you / What readers should do next]
```
