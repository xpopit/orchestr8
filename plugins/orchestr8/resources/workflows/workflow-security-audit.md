# Security Audit Pattern

**Methodology:** Reconnaissance → Assessment → Remediation Planning

**Scope Options:** Application layer, API, infrastructure, or full stack

**Token Efficiency:**
- Without JIT: ~18,000 tokens upfront (all security resources loaded)
- With JIT: ~3,000 tokens progressive (loaded by assessment area)
- **Savings: 83%**

## Phase Structure (0% → 100%)

### Phase 1: Reconnaissance (0-20%)

**→ Load Reconnaissance & Threat Modeling Expertise (JIT):**
```
@orchestr8://match?query=security+threat+modeling+attack+surface+${tech-stack}&categories=skill,pattern&maxTokens=1000
@orchestr8://skills/requirement-analysis-framework
```

**Goals:** Map attack surface and security context

**Key Activities:**
- Identify all entry points (APIs, forms, file uploads, webhooks)
- Map authentication and authorization flows
- List third-party dependencies and integrations
- Document data flows and sensitive data storage (PII, credentials, tokens)
- Review existing security controls (WAF, rate limiting, encryption)
- Enumerate trust boundaries and privilege levels

**Output:** Attack surface map and security inventory

### Phase 2: Vulnerability Assessment (20-80%)

**→ Load Core Security Assessment Expertise (JIT):**
```
@orchestr8://match?query=owasp+security+vulnerabilities+${tech-stack}&categories=skill,agent&maxTokens=2500
@orchestr8://skills/security-owasp-top10
@orchestr8://agents/security-owasp-vulnerabilities
```

**Goals:** Identify security vulnerabilities across all dimensions

**Parallel Tracks:**

**Track A: OWASP Top 10 (20-60%)**

**→ OWASP Expertise (loaded above, reused across all tracks):**

Systematically evaluate each category:

1. **Broken Access Control:** Horizontal/vertical privilege escalation, IDOR, missing auth checks
2. **Cryptographic Failures:** Weak encryption, plaintext sensitive data, insecure protocols
3. **Injection:** SQL, NoSQL, command, LDAP, XPath injection vulnerabilities
4. **Insecure Design:** Missing security controls, threat modeling gaps
5. **Security Misconfiguration:** Default credentials, verbose errors, unnecessary features enabled
6. **Vulnerable Components:** Outdated dependencies with known CVEs
7. **Authentication Failures:** Weak passwords, missing MFA, broken session management
8. **Data Integrity Failures:** Unsigned updates, insecure deserialization
9. **Logging/Monitoring Failures:** Missing audit logs, no alerting on suspicious activity
10. **SSRF:** Server-side request forgery, unvalidated URLs

**Track B: Dependency Audit (25-50%)**

**→ Dependency Security (JIT - CONDITIONAL):**
```
# Only if application has external dependencies
@orchestr8://match?query=${package-manager}+dependency+audit+cve&categories=skill&maxTokens=800
```
- Run security scanners: `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`, Snyk
- Check for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) with severity ratings
- Verify dependency versions are current and patched
- Assess transitive dependencies
- Review license compliance (GPL, MIT, Apache)

**Track C: Infrastructure Security (30-65%)**

**→ Infrastructure Security (JIT - CONDITIONAL):**
```
# Only if infrastructure/cloud components in scope
@orchestr8://match?query=${cloud-provider}+infrastructure+security+hardening&categories=skill,pattern&maxTokens=1000
@orchestr8://skills/security-secrets-management
```
- Network configuration review (firewalls, security groups, network policies)
- TLS/SSL configuration and certificate validation
- Secrets management (no hardcoded secrets, proper vault usage)
- Container security (Dockerfile best practices, image scanning)
- CI/CD pipeline security (credential handling, approval gates)
- Cloud resource configuration (S3 buckets public, IAM overpermissive)

**Track D: Authentication & Authorization (35-70%)**

**→ Auth Security (loaded in core assessment, reused here):**
```
# Expertise already loaded in Phase 2 core assessment
# Reuse: security-owasp-top10, security-owasp-vulnerabilities
```
- Password policies (length, complexity, hashing algorithm: bcrypt/Argon2)
- Session management (secure tokens, expiration, invalidation)
- OAuth/OIDC implementation review (proper state, PKCE)
- RBAC/permissions enforcement (consistently applied)
- Multi-factor authentication (TOTP, U2F support)
- API key management and rotation

**Track E: Data Protection (40-75%)**

**→ Data Protection & Compliance (JIT - CONDITIONAL):**
```
# Only if handling sensitive data or compliance requirements
@orchestr8://match?query=${compliance-standard}+data+protection+encryption&categories=skill,agent&maxTokens=1200
```
- Encryption at rest (AES-256, database encryption)
- Encryption in transit (TLS 1.2+, certificate validation)
- PII/sensitive data handling (minimization, pseudonymization)
- Data retention and secure deletion policies
- Backup security (encrypted, access controlled)
- Compliance gaps (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS)

**Output:** Comprehensive vulnerability findings with severity ratings (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

### Phase 3: Reporting & Remediation Planning (80-100%)

**→ Load Remediation & Reporting Expertise (JIT):**
```
@orchestr8://match?query=security+remediation+reporting+cvss&categories=skill&maxTokens=800
@orchestr8://skills/technical-writing-principles
```

**Goals:** Deliver actionable security recommendations

**Key Activities:**
- Categorize findings by severity using CVSS scoring
- Provide specific remediation steps with code examples
- Estimate remediation effort (hours/days) and priority
- Create security improvement roadmap (quick wins, strategic fixes)
- Document compliance gaps with requirements
- Recommend security tools and processes

**Report Structure:**

**Executive Summary:**
- Overall security posture assessment
- Critical findings requiring immediate attention
- Risk summary and business impact

**Detailed Findings:**
- Organized by OWASP category or component
- Each finding includes:
  - Description and impact
  - Proof of concept (if applicable)
  - Severity rating with justification
  - Remediation steps with code examples
  - References to standards/best practices

**Remediation Roadmap:**
- **Immediate (Week 1):** Critical vulnerabilities (RCE, SQLi, auth bypass)
- **Short-term (Month 1):** High severity issues (XSS, CSRF, sensitive data exposure)
- **Medium-term (Quarter 1):** Medium severity and compliance gaps
- **Long-term (Year 1):** Low severity and security hardening

**Output:** Security audit report with prioritized remediation plan

## Parallelism Strategy

**All assessment tracks run concurrently:**
- OWASP, dependencies, infrastructure, auth, data protection assessed simultaneously
- Maximizes audit efficiency

## Critical Security Principles

**Defense in Depth:** Multiple security layers (network, application, data)
**Least Privilege:** Minimal permissions required for functionality
**Fail Secure:** Errors should deny access, not grant it
**Security by Design:** Not an afterthought

## Success Criteria
- All OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities assessed
- Dependencies scanned for CVEs
- Infrastructure security reviewed
- Findings categorized by severity
- Remediation plan with specific steps
- Compliance gaps documented

## JIT Loading Strategy

**Progressive & Conditional Loading:**
1. Phase 1: Load reconnaissance and threat modeling (1000 tokens)
2. Phase 2: Load core OWASP assessment expertise (2500 tokens), then conditionally load:
   - Dependency audit if dependencies exist (800 tokens)
   - Infrastructure security if cloud/infra in scope (1000 tokens)
   - Data protection/compliance if handling sensitive data (1200 tokens)
   - Auth expertise reused from core assessment (0 additional tokens)
3. Phase 3: Load remediation and reporting expertise (800 tokens)

**Adaptive Scope:**
- Minimal (app-only audit): ~4,300 tokens (reconnaissance + OWASP + reporting)
- Typical (app + dependencies): ~5,100 tokens
- Full stack (app + infra + compliance): ~6,500 tokens
- Comprehensive (all areas): ~6,500 tokens

**Token Savings:**
- Traditional approach: Load all security expertise upfront = ~18,000 tokens
- JIT approach: Load only needed assessment areas = ~4,300-6,500 tokens
- **Savings: 64-76% depending on audit scope**

**Reuse Pattern:**
Core OWASP expertise loaded once in Phase 2 is reused across all parallel assessment tracks, avoiding redundant loading.
