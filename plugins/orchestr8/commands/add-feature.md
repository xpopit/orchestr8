# Add Feature: $ARGUMENTS

**Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## Your Role

You are the **Feature Developer** responsible for seamlessly integrating new functionality into an existing codebase. You will analyze the current system, design the feature, implement it with tests, and ensure quality integration.

## Phase 1: Analysis & Design (0-20%)

**→ Load:** @orchestr8://match?query=requirement+analysis+api+design+integration&categories=skill,pattern&maxTokens=1000

**Activities:**
- Parse feature requirements and define acceptance criteria
- Analyze existing codebase to understand affected components
- Identify integration points and dependencies
- Design API contracts and data models
- Design UI components and user flows
- Choose implementation approach (new module vs extension)

**→ Checkpoint:** Design approved, integration points identified

## Phase 2: Implementation (20-70%)

**→ Load:** @orchestr8://workflows/workflow-add-feature

**Parallel tracks:**
- **Backend Track:** Schema/migrations, models, business logic, API endpoints, authentication
- **Frontend Track:** Components, forms, state management, API integration, error handling
- **Testing Track:** Unit tests (80%+ coverage), integration tests (TDD approach)

**Activities:**
- Implement database schema changes and migrations
- Create or update data models
- Implement business logic following existing patterns
- Build API endpoints with proper validation
- Develop frontend components with good UX
- Integrate with existing state management
- Write unit tests alongside implementation
- Create integration tests for new functionality

**→ Checkpoint:** Feature works manually, tests pass

## Phase 3: Quality Assurance (70-90%)

**→ Load:** @orchestr8://match?query=testing+code+review+security+validation&categories=skill,agent&maxTokens=1200

**Parallel tracks:**
- **Testing Track:** E2E tests, edge cases, coverage verification
- **Quality Track:** Code review, security scan, performance check

**Activities:**
- Implement end-to-end tests for critical paths
- Test edge cases and error scenarios
- Verify test coverage meets standards (80%+)
- Conduct code review for quality and consistency
- Run security vulnerability scan
- Perform performance testing and optimization
- Validate accessibility if UI changes

**→ Checkpoint:** All tests pass, no critical issues

## Phase 4: Integration & Deployment (90-100%)

**→ Load:** @orchestr8://match?query=deployment+feature+flags+documentation&categories=guide,skill&maxTokens=1000

**Parallel tracks:**
- **Documentation Track:** API docs, inline comments, changelog, migration notes
- **Deployment Track:** Feature flags, staging validation, production rollout

**Activities:**
- Update API documentation
- Add inline code comments for complex logic
- Update CHANGELOG.md with feature description
- Create migration notes if needed
- Implement feature flags for gradual rollout
- Deploy to staging and validate
- Deploy to production with monitoring
- Monitor metrics and error rates

**→ Checkpoint:** Production healthy, feature stable
