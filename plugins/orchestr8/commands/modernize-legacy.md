---# Legacy System Modernization

**Request:** ${user_request}

## Your Role

You are the **Modernization Architect** coordinating comprehensive legacy system analysis and cloud migration planning for enterprise architecture teams.

## Overview

This command provides end-to-end legacy system modernization planning including:
- **Deep Service-Level Analysis** - Analyze 20-50+ services with granular dependency mapping
- **Cloud Migration Planning** - Azure/AWS/GCP architecture with HA/DR strategies
- **Microservices Transformation** - Domain-driven design and decomposition strategies
- **Session-Based Output Organization** - All artifacts organized in calling directory

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Cloud Migration for Legacy Application

```
User: "Analyze the legacy .NET application in /codeRepos/LegacyApp and create a cloud migration plan for Azure with HA/DR"

Analysis includes:
- 30+ service inventory and dependency mapping
- Performance and security assessment
- Azure architecture design with AKS
- Warm Standby DR strategy (30-min RTO)
- Good/better/best migration approaches
- TCO analysis and implementation roadmap

All outputs in: /calling-dir/.orchestr8/session_<timestamp>/
```

### Use Case 2: Microservices Transformation

```
User: "Evaluate the monolith in /codeRepos/Monolith for microservices transformation"

Analysis includes:
- Domain-driven design analysis
- Service boundary recommendations
- Data decomposition strategy
- Strangler fig migration approach
- Phased implementation roadmap

All outputs in: /calling-dir/.orchestr8/session_<timestamp>/
```

### Use Case 3: Full Modernization (Cloud + Microservices)

```
User: "Complete modernization plan for /codeRepos/LegacySystem - cloud migration to AWS and microservices transformation"

Analysis includes:
- Everything from Use Case 1 and 2 combined
- Cloud-native microservices architecture on AWS EKS
- Event-driven architecture design
- Complete transformation roadmap

All outputs in: /calling-dir/.orchestr8/session_<timestamp>/
```

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Clarify Requirements

**Ask user:**
```markdown
To create a comprehensive modernization plan, I need to understand:

1. **Codebase Location:**
   - Where is the legacy system? (e.g., /codeRepos/MyApp)

2. **Modernization Goals:**
   - [ ] Cloud migration (Azure, AWS, or GCP?)
   - [ ] Microservices transformation
   - [ ] Both (full modernization)

3. **Current State:**
   - What type of application? (Web, API, monolith, distributed services)
   - Approximate number of services/projects (if known)
   - Technology stack (if known)

4. **Requirements (if applicable):**
   - Availability targets (99.9%, 99.95%, 99.99%)?
   - RPO/RTO requirements for DR?
   - Compliance needs (HIPAA, SOC2, PCI-DSS, GDPR)?
   - Budget constraints?
   - Timeline expectations?

I'll analyze the codebase to discover specifics, but this context helps prioritize the analysis.
```

### Step 2: Initialize Session

**Based on user responses, initialize session:**

```typescript
const sessionDir = await initSession({
  workflowType: determineWorkflowType(), // cloud-migration, microservices, or both
  analyzedCodebase: userProvidedPath,
  metadata: {
    targetCloud: userSpecifiedCloud,
    hadrRequired: userHADRRequirement,
    complianceRequirements: userComplianceNeeds,
    transformationType: 'full-modernization'
  }
})

console.log(`
🚀 Starting Legacy System Modernization Analysis

📁 Session: ${sessionDir}
🔍 Analyzing: ${analyzedCodebase}
📊 Analysis Type: ${workflowType}

Your analysis artifacts will be organized in:
${sessionDir}

Starting Phase 1: Discovery & Assessment...
`)
```

### Step 3: Launch Appropriate Workflow(s)

**Option A: Cloud Migration Only**

```markdown
→ Load and execute:
@orchestr8://workflows/workflow-cloud-migration-planning

Phases:
1. Legacy System Assessment (0-25%)
2. Cloud Architecture Design (25-50%)
3. HA/DR Strategy (50-70%)
4. Migration Strategy & Cost (70-90%)
5. Implementation Roadmap (90-100%)

Deliverables:
- Service dependency map
- Target cloud architecture
- HA/DR strategy
- Good/better/best migration approaches
- TCO analysis
- Implementation roadmap
```

**Option B: Microservices Transformation Only**

```markdown
→ Load and execute:
@orchestr8://workflows/workflow-microservices-transformation

Phases:
1. Monolith Analysis (0-25%)
2. Service Boundary Identification (25-50%)
3. Data Decomposition Strategy (50-70%)
4. Transformation Approach (70-90%)
5. Implementation Roadmap (90-100%)

Deliverables:
- Domain model and bounded contexts
- Service boundary recommendations
- Data decomposition strategy
- Strangler fig migration plan
- Implementation roadmap
```

**Option C: Full Modernization (Cloud + Microservices)**

```markdown
→ Load and execute both workflows sequentially:

First: Cloud Migration Planning
- Establishes cloud infrastructure design
- Defines HA/DR strategy
- Selects cloud platform and services

Then: Microservices Transformation
- Designs service boundaries on top of cloud architecture
- Combines cloud-native patterns with microservices
- Creates unified modernization roadmap

Final deliverable:
- Comprehensive modernization plan
- Cloud-native microservices architecture
- Phased implementation combining both transformations
```

💡 **Tip:** Your analyzed codebase remains clean - no artifacts written to source directories.
```

## Key Features

### Session-Based Output Management

**Problem Solved:**
```
❌ Before: Artifacts scattered across directories
/calling-dir/architecture-diagrams.md
/codebase/technical-debt.md  ← pollutes source!
/codebase/.orchestr8/report.md

✅ After: Organized in session directory
/calling-dir/.orchestr8/session_2025-11-11T14-30-00/
  ├── analysis/
  ├── architecture/
  ├── modernization/
  └── ...
  
/codebase/ ← clean, no artifacts
```

### Deep Service-Level Analysis

**Handles enterprise complexity:**
- Multi-solution codebases (Web + API + Services)
- 30-50+ individual services
- Cross-service dependency mapping
- Database-per-service planning
- Performance and security flags at service level

### Cloud Migration Planning

**Complete migration strategy:**
- Azure/AWS/GCP architecture design
- HA/DR strategies with specific RPO/RTO
- Good/better/best migration approaches
- TCO calculations and ROI analysis
- Phased implementation roadmaps

### Microservices Transformation

**Domain-driven decomposition:**
- Bounded context identification
- Service boundary recommendations
- Data decomposition strategies
- Strangler fig migration patterns
- Event-driven architecture design

## Best Practices

### For Architecture Teams

✅ **Run from workspace directory** - Not from codebase
   ```bash
   # Good: Run from your workspace
   cd /workspace/architecture-reviews
   # Analyze external codebase
   "Analyze /codeRepos/LegacyApp for cloud migration"
   
   # Outputs go to /workspace/architecture-reviews/.orchestr8/session_xxx/
   ```

✅ **Specify requirements upfront** - Save analysis time
   ```markdown
   Include in request:
   - Cloud preference (Azure/AWS/GCP)
   - Availability requirements (99.95%)
   - Compliance needs (HIPAA, SOC2)
   - Budget constraints
   ```

✅ **Review session metadata** - Understand analysis scope
   ```bash
   cat .orchestr8/latest/metadata.json
   ```

✅ **Use structured outputs** - YAML for automation
   ```yaml
   # service-map.yaml - Machine readable
   # Can be consumed by migration tools
   ```

### For Multiple Analyses

✅ **Sessions isolate concurrent analyses**
   ```
   Run multiple analyses from same directory:
   .orchestr8/
   ├── session_2025-11-11T10-00-00/  ← Project A
   ├── session_2025-11-11T14-30-00/  ← Project B
   ├── session_2025-11-11T16-45-00/  ← Project C
   └── latest → session_2025-11-11T16-45-00/
   ```
