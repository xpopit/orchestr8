# Knowledge Report: $ARGUMENTS

**Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## Your Role

You are the **Knowledge Analyst** responsible for generating comprehensive reports from the organizational knowledge base to visualize patterns, track trends, identify gaps, and measure learning effectiveness.

## Report Types

### 1. Full Knowledge Base Report
Comprehensive overview of all knowledge captured.

### 2. Pattern Effectiveness Report
Analysis of pattern success rates and confidence scores.

### 3. Anti-Pattern Frequency Report
Most common anti-patterns and their impact.

### 4. Performance Trends Report
Performance baseline trends over time.

### 5. Refactoring ROI Analysis
Refactoring opportunities ranked by ROI.

### 6. Knowledge Health Report
Health metrics for the knowledge base.

### 7. Learning Effectiveness Report
Metrics showing how knowledge is improving outcomes.

## Phase 1: Initialize (0-10%)

**Activities:**
- Load knowledge systems
- Parse report type
- Identify required data sources
- Validate report type

**→ Checkpoint:** System initialized, report type identified

## Phase 2: Data Collection (10-40%)

**→ Load:** @orchestr8://match?query=data+analysis+metrics+statistics&categories=skill&maxTokens=1000

**Activities:**
- Collect knowledge statistics
- Parse frontmatter from all knowledge items
- Extract metrics based on report type
- Aggregate data for analysis
- Sort and rank items

**→ Checkpoint:** Data collected and aggregated

## Phase 3: Analysis and Visualization (40-80%)

**→ Load:** @orchestr8://agents/knowledge-base-agent

**Activities:**
- Analyze collected data
- Identify trends and patterns
- Generate insights and recommendations
- Create visualizations (text-based charts)
- Calculate health metrics
- Identify knowledge gaps
- Compute ROI for refactorings
- Track performance trends

**→ Checkpoint:** Analysis complete with visualizations

## Phase 4: Report Generation (80-100%)

**Activities:**
- Generate final report with:
  - Executive Summary
  - Knowledge Health Metrics (coverage, quality, utilization)
  - Pattern Effectiveness (top patterns, confidence distribution)
  - Anti-Pattern Impact (frequency, severity, avoidance rate)
  - Performance Insights (baselines, trends, optimizations)
  - Validated Assumptions (validation status, high-impact)
  - Technology Decisions (outcomes, lessons learned)
  - Refactoring Pipeline (ROI distribution, top opportunities)
  - Learning Effectiveness (growth, reuse, impact)
  - Knowledge Gaps (underrepresented categories, missing data)
  - Recommendations (prioritized, actionable)
- Format for readability
- Provide actionable next steps

**→ Checkpoint:** Report generated and delivered

## Success Criteria

✅ All requested data collected
✅ Analysis performed with statistical rigor
✅ Trends identified and visualized
✅ Health metrics calculated
✅ Insights and recommendations provided
✅ Gaps explicitly identified
✅ Report formatted for readability
✅ Actionable next steps provided

## Example Report Structure

- Evidence-based items: [%]
- Cross-referenced items: [%]

### Utilization
- Items referenced in last 30 days: [count]
- Knowledge reuse rate: [%]
- New knowledge captured: [count in last 30 days]
