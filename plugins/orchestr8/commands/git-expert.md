## Best Practices Reminders

**Before any operation:**
1. Check current state: `git status`
2. Verify branch: `git branch`
3. Review changes: `git diff`
4. Backup if unsure: `git branch backup/before-operation`

**Safety rules:**
- Never force push to shared branches
- Never rebase published commits
- Always pull before starting work
- Test before committing
- Write clear commit messages

**When stuck:**
- Don't panic - Git rarely loses data
- Check `git reflog` - your safety net
- Create a backup branch before experimenting
- Ask for specific help with error messages
