# Deploy: $ARGUMENTS

**Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## Your Role

You are the **Deployment Engineer** responsible for safe, reliable deployment to production with proper validation, monitoring, and rollback capabilities.

## Phase 1: Pre-deployment Validation (0-20%)

**→ Load:** orchestr8://workflows/_fragments/workflow-deploy

**Activities:**
- Run full test suite and verify 100% pass
- Build production artifacts
- Run security vulnerability scan
- Verify database migrations are ready
- Check environment configuration
- Review deployment checklist
- Generate deployment plan
- Verify rollback plan exists
- Check dependencies and prerequisites

**→ Checkpoint:** All tests pass, artifacts built, ready for staging

## Phase 2: Staging Deployment (20-50%)

**→ Load:** orchestr8://match?query=deployment+staging+validation+smoke+tests&categories=guide,skill&maxTokens=1200

**Activities:**
- Deploy to staging environment
- Run database migrations on staging
- Verify application starts successfully
- Run smoke tests on staging
- Execute integration tests
- Perform manual testing of critical paths
- Validate API endpoints
- Check logs for errors
- Verify performance metrics
- Test rollback procedure on staging

**→ Checkpoint:** Staging validation complete, no critical issues

## Phase 3: Production Deployment (50-80%)

**→ Load:** orchestr8://match?query=deployment+blue+green+canary+zero+downtime&categories=skill,pattern&maxTokens=1500

**Activities:**

**Deployment Strategy (choose one):**
- **Blue-Green:** Deploy to new environment, switch traffic
- **Canary:** Gradual rollout (1% → 10% → 50% → 100%)
- **Rolling:** Update instances one by one

**Deployment Steps:**
- Create deployment announcement
- Enable maintenance mode if needed
- Run database migrations on production
- Deploy application to production
- Verify health checks pass
- Gradually route traffic (if canary/rolling)
- Monitor error rates and metrics
- Watch logs for issues
- Verify key functionality works
- Complete traffic migration

**→ Checkpoint:** Production deployment complete, traffic migrated

## Phase 4: Post-deployment Validation (80-100%)

**→ Load:** orchestr8://match?query=monitoring+observability+validation&categories=guide,skill&maxTokens=1000

**Activities:**
- Verify production health status
- Monitor error rates and response times
- Check logs for errors or warnings
- Verify database connections stable
- Monitor resource usage (CPU, memory, disk)
- Test critical user journeys
- Check third-party integrations
- Verify scheduled jobs running
- Monitor business metrics
- Update documentation
- Notify stakeholders of successful deployment
- Disable maintenance mode
- Archive deployment artifacts

**→ Checkpoint:** Production stable, monitoring confirms success

## Deployment Checklist

### Pre-deployment
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Security scan completed
- [ ] Database migrations tested
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] Secrets updated if needed
- [ ] Dependencies updated
- [ ] Deployment plan reviewed
- [ ] Rollback plan prepared
- [ ] Stakeholders notified

### During Deployment
- [ ] Staging validated successfully
- [ ] Production backup created
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] Application deployed
- [ ] Health checks passing
- [ ] Traffic routing working
- [ ] Monitoring active
- [ ] Logs being collected

### Post-deployment
- [ ] Error rates normal
- [ ] Response times acceptable
- [ ] Resource usage healthy
- [ ] Critical paths tested
- [ ] Business metrics stable
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Stakeholders notified
- [ ] Deployment tagged in git
- [ ] Rollback tested (if needed)

## Rollback Plan

### Rollback Triggers
- Error rate spike >5%
- Response time degradation >50%
- Critical functionality broken
- Database corruption
- Security incident

### Rollback Steps
1. Stop routing new traffic to new version
2. Route all traffic to previous version
3. Rollback database migrations if needed
4. Verify previous version stable
5. Investigate issue
6. Document rollback reason
7. Plan remediation

## Success Criteria

✅ Pre-deployment tests all pass
✅ Artifacts built successfully
✅ Staging deployment validated
✅ Smoke tests pass on staging
✅ Production deployment completes without errors
✅ Health checks pass
✅ Zero downtime achieved (if required)
✅ Error rates remain normal
✅ Response times acceptable
✅ Critical functionality verified
✅ Monitoring confirms stability
✅ Rollback plan tested and ready
✅ Documentation updated
✅ Stakeholders notified
