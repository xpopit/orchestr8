### Step 2: High-Level Review
- Review overall approach
- Check if solution fits architecture
- Verify design patterns appropriate
- Assess complexity

### Step 3: Detailed Code Review
- Review each file systematically
- Use checklist above
- Note issues by severity:
  * 🔴 **Critical**: Must fix (security, data loss, crashes)
  * 🟡 **Major**: Should fix (bugs, poor practices)
  * 🔵 **Minor**: Nice to fix (style, readability)
  * 💡 **Suggestion**: Consider for improvement

### Step 4: Testing Review
- Review test files

```

## Example Review Comments

### Good Comments

✅ **Specific and actionable:**
```
src/auth/login.ts:45
🔴 Security Issue: Password is logged in plain text.
Remove or mask the password in the log statement.
```

✅ **Explains why:**
```
src/api/users.ts:123
🟡 This will cause an N+1 query problem. Consider using
eager loading with `include` to fetch related data in
a single query.
```

✅ **Provides alternative:**
```
src/utils/date.ts:67
💡 Consider using date-fns or day.js instead of moment.js.
Moment is in maintenance mode and these alternatives have
smaller bundle sizes.
```

### Bad Comments

❌ **Vague:**
```
This is not good.
```

❌ **Not actionable:**
```
There might be a better way to do this.
```

❌ **Unnecessarily harsh:**
```
This code is terrible. Rewrite it.
```

## Common Issues to Watch For

### Performance Anti-Patterns
- **N+1 Queries**: Multiple queries in a loop
- **Missing Indexes**: Queries without proper indexes
- **Inefficient Algorithms**: O(n²) when O(n) possible
- **Memory Leaks**: Event listeners not cleaned up
- **Large Bundle Sizes**: Importing entire libraries for one function

### Security Anti-Patterns
- **SQL Injection**: String concatenation for queries
- **XSS**: Unescaped user input in HTML
- **Hardcoded Secrets**: API keys, passwords in code
- **Missing Authentication**: Endpoints without auth checks
- **Insecure Randomness**: Using Math.random() for security

### Code Quality Anti-Patterns
- **God Classes**: Classes that do too much
- **Deep Nesting**: 5+ levels of nesting
- **Magic Numbers**: Unexplained numeric literals
- **Long Functions**: 100+ line functions
- **Duplicated Code**: Copy-pasted logic

### Testing Anti-Patterns
- **No Tests**: No test coverage at all
- **Testing Implementation**: Testing private methods
- **Flaky Tests**: Tests that fail randomly
- **Test Interdependence**: Tests that depend on each other
- **Mocking Everything**: Over-mocking defeats the purpose

## Best Practices

### DO
✅ Be constructive and respectful
✅ Explain the "why" behind suggestions
✅ Provide examples or alternatives
✅ Acknowledge good work
✅ Focus on the code, not the person
✅ Prioritize issues by severity
✅ Check if automated tools caught issues
✅ Consider maintainability and future developers

### DON'T
❌ Be nitpicky about style (let linters handle it)
❌ Demand perfection (good enough is often good enough)
❌ Rewrite code in comments (suggest approach)
❌ Be vague or unclear
❌ Approve without reviewing
❌ Block PRs for minor issues
❌ Review while tired or rushed
❌ Take too long to review (review promptly)
