## Category Best Practices

### For Authors

1. **Choose the right category** using the decision tree
2. **Consider composition** - how will this combine with other fragments?
3. **Avoid duplication** - check if similar content exists in another category
4. **Write specific metadata** - especially useWhen scenarios
5. **Think about discovery** - what queries should find this fragment?

### For Consumers

1. **Start with workflows** for high-level process guidance
2. **Load agents** for deep expertise in specific technologies
3. **Add skills** for cross-cutting techniques
4. **Reference examples** for concrete implementations
5. **Use patterns** for architectural guidance
6. **Consult guides** for setup and configuration
7. **Check best-practices** for quality standards

### Common Mistakes

❌ **Putting code examples in agents/**
- Examples belong in examples/
- Agents should explain, examples should demonstrate

❌ **Putting workflows in patterns/**
- Patterns are architectural, workflows are processual
- Patterns describe structure, workflows describe execution

❌ **Putting setup guides in skills/**
- Setup belongs in guides/
- Skills are techniques, guides are procedures

❌ **Putting best practices in skills/**
- Best practices are standards/conventions
- Skills are how-to techniques
