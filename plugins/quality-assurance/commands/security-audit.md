Example:
FINDING: SQL Injection in user search
SEVERITY: Critical
LOCATION: api/search.py:45
DESCRIPTION: User input directly concatenated into SQL query
IMPACT: Attacker can read/modify database, escalate privileges
REMEDIATION:
1. Replace string concatenation with parameterized query
2. Add input validation
3. Add WAF rule
4. Add regression test
EFFORT: 2 hours
ASSIGNED TO: python-developer + test-engineer
```

#### 3. Auto-Remediation (Safe Fixes)

**Automatically fix these without approval:**

```bash
# Update dependencies

npm install helmet
# Code will be added automatically

# Remove hardcoded secrets
# - Move to environment variables
# - Add to .gitignore
# - Rotate compromised secrets

# Fix Dockerfile issues
# - Use non-root user
# - Pin versions
# - Multi-stage build
```

#### 4. Manual Remediation (Complex Fixes)

**Require approval before fixing:**

```
REQUIRES HUMAN APPROVAL:
- Architectural changes
- Authentication/authorization refactoring
- Database schema changes
- API contract changes
- Breaking changes
- High-risk code modifications

PROCESS:
1. Agent proposes fix with detailed plan

6. Deploy to staging
7. Validate fix
8. Deploy to production
```

#### 5. Verification

```
For each remediation:
1. Fix implemented
2. Regression test added
3. Vulnerability scan confirms fix
4. Code review passed
5. No new vulnerabilities introduced
6. Documented in security log
```

Expected outputs:

### Example 2: Pre-Production Security Gate

```bash
/security-audit "Security gate before production deployment. Focus on API security, authentication, and data protection. Quick turnaround needed."
```

**Autonomous execution:**
1. Focused scope (API + auth + data)
2. Fast scans (skip IaC, focus on code)
3. OWASP API Security Top 10 review
4. Critical/high findings only
5. Must-fix issues identified
6. Auto-remediation where safe
7. Quick report with go/no-go decision

**Time: 1-2 hours**

### Example 3: Compliance Audit

```bash
/security-audit "HIPAA compliance audit for patient portal. Must validate all PHI handling, encryption, access controls, and audit logging."
```

**Autonomous execution:**
1. HIPAA-focused scope
2. PHI data flow mapping
3. Encryption validation (at rest, in transit)
4. Access control review
5. Audit log verification
6. BAA (Business Associate Agreement) review
7. HIPAA Security Rule checklist
8. Compliance report with gaps
9. Remediation for non-compliant items

**Time: 4-8 hours**

## Anti-Patterns

### DON'T
❌ Skip automated scans (they catch 80% of issues)
❌ Fix without understanding impact
❌ Deploy security fixes without testing
❌ Ignore medium/low vulnerabilities indefinitely
❌ Have compliance audit only once a year
❌ Store security reports in public repos
❌ Auto-fix authentication/authorization without review
❌ Dismiss false positives without investigation

### DO
✅ Run automated scans first (fast feedback)
✅ Understand root cause before fixing
✅ Test security fixes thoroughly
✅ Have remediation plan for all severities
✅ Regular security audits (quarterly minimum)
✅ Store reports securely with access control
✅ Human review for security-critical changes
✅ Investigate false positives (sometimes real issues)

## Continuous Security
