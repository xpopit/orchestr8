# Pull Request Review Workflow

You are orchestrating a comprehensive pull request review with multi-stage code analysis, GitHub integration, and automated feedback delivery.

## Intelligence Database Integration

```bash

# Initialize workflow

echo "🚀 Starting PR Review Workflow"
echo "PR Number: $1"
echo "Workflow ID: $workflow_id"

# Query similar PR review patterns
```

## Workflow Overview

This workflow provides thorough PR review by:
1. Fetching PR details from GitHub
2. Analyzing changed files across 5 quality dimensions
3. Posting detailed review comments to the PR
4. Requesting changes or approving based on findings
5. Supporting iterative review cycles

---

## Phase 1: PR Context Gathering (0-10%)

**⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
```
Use the debugger agent to:
1. Fetch PR details from GitHub (number, title, body, author, branches)
2. Get PR diff and identify all changed files
3. Categorize files by type (frontend, backend, tests, config, docs)
4. Analyze PR context (size, change type, risk level, related issues)
5. Create review plan with TodoWrite

subagent_type: "quality-assurance:debugger"
description: "Gather PR context and metadata"
prompt: "Fetch and analyze Pull Request #$1:

Tasks:

1. **Get PR Details**
   \`\`\`bash
   # Fetch PR metadata
   gh pr view $1 --json number,title,body,author,headRefName,baseRefName,state,isDraft,commits,files

   # Get PR diff
   gh pr diff $1

   # Get PR commits
   gh pr view $1 --json commits
   \`\`\`

2. **Identify Changed Files**
   \`\`\`bash
   # List all files changed in PR
   gh pr diff $1 --name-only

   # Categorize files by type
   # Frontend: *.tsx, *.jsx, *.vue, *.svelte
   # Backend: *.ts, *.js, *.py, *.go, *.java, *.rs
   # Tests: *.test.*, *.spec.*
   # Config: *.json, *.yaml, *.yml
   # Docs: *.md
   \`\`\`

3. **Analyze PR Context**
   - PR size (lines changed, files modified)
   - Change type (feature, bugfix, refactor, docs)
   - Risk level (high for auth/security, medium for business logic, low for docs)
   - Related issues/tickets

4. **Create Review Plan**
   Use TodoWrite to track review stages:
   - [ ] Validate PR metadata (title, description, linked issues)
   - [ ] Stage 1: Style & Readability Review
   - [ ] Stage 2: Logic & Correctness Review
   - [ ] Stage 3: Security Audit
   - [ ] Stage 4: Performance Analysis
   - [ ] Stage 5: Architecture Review
   - [ ] Generate review summary
   - [ ] Post review to GitHub

Expected outputs:
- pr-context-$1.json - PR metadata
- changed-files-$1.txt - List of changed files
- review-plan-$1.md - Structured review plan
"
```

**Expected Outputs:**
- `pr-context-<PR#>.json` - PR metadata and context
- `changed-files-<PR#>.txt` - List of changed files with categories
- `review-plan-<PR#>.md` - Structured review plan

**Quality Gate: Context Validation**
```bash
PR_NUMBER="$1"

# Validate PR exists
if ! gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" &>/dev/null; then
  echo "❌ PR #$PR_NUMBER not found"
  exit 1
fi

# Validate context files created
if [ ! -f "pr-context-$PR_NUMBER.json" ]; then
  echo "❌ PR context not gathered"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ PR context gathered successfully"
```

**Track Progress:**
```bash
TOKENS_USED=3000

# Store PR metadata
  "PR #$PR_NUMBER context and metadata" \
  "$(head -n 50 pr-context-$PR_NUMBER.json)"
```

---

## Phase 2: PR Metadata Validation (10-15%)

**⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
```
Use the code-reviewer agent to:
1. Validate PR title follows Conventional Commits format
2. Check PR description quality (what, why, testing notes)
3. Verify linked issues/tickets
4. Check for screenshots if UI changes
5. Validate metadata (labels, reviewers, milestone)

subagent_type: "quality-assurance:code-reviewer"
description: "Validate PR metadata quality"
prompt: "Validate metadata for PR #$PR_NUMBER:

Validation Checklist:

1. **Title Validation:**
   - [ ] Follows Conventional Commits format (feat:, fix:, docs:, etc.)
   - [ ] Clear and descriptive
   - [ ] References ticket/issue if applicable

2. **Description Validation:**
   - [ ] Explains what and why (not just what)
   - [ ] Links to related issues/tickets
   - [ ] Includes testing notes
   - [ ] Screenshots for UI changes
   - [ ] Breaking changes documented

3. **Metadata Checks:**
   - [ ] Appropriate labels applied
   - [ ] Reviewers assigned
   - [ ] Milestone set (if applicable)
   - [ ] Not a draft (or marked WIP)

If validation fails, generate comment requesting improvements:
\`\`\`bash
gh pr comment $PR_NUMBER --body \"## PR Metadata Issues

Please address the following before review:
- [ ] Add conventional commit prefix to title (feat:, fix:, etc.)
- [ ] Add description explaining changes
- [ ] Link related issue/ticket
- [ ] Add testing notes

Use \\\`gh pr edit $PR_NUMBER\\\` to update.\"
\`\`\`

Expected outputs:
- metadata-validation-$PR_NUMBER.md - Validation results
- metadata-issues-$PR_NUMBER.txt - List of issues (if any)
"
```

**Expected Outputs:**
- `metadata-validation-<PR#>.md` - Validation results
- `metadata-issues-<PR#>.txt` - Issues found (empty if valid)

**Quality Gate: Metadata Validation**
```bash
# Check if metadata validation passed
if [ -s "metadata-issues-$PR_NUMBER.txt" ]; then
  echo "⚠️ PR metadata has issues, posting comment"
  gh pr comment "$PR_NUMBER" --body-file "metadata-issues-$PR_NUMBER.txt"
  echo "Continuing with code review..."

# Display metrics
```

---

## Iterative Re-Review

**When Developer Pushes New Commits:**

1. **Detect new commits:**
   ```bash
   gh pr view $PR_NUMBER --json commits
   ```

2. **Identify changed files since last review:**
   ```bash
   git diff <last-review-commit> <new-commit> --name-only
   ```

3. **Targeted re-review:**
   - Only review files changed since last review
   - Re-run only affected stages
   - Verify previous issues are fixed
   - Check for new issues

4. **Update review status:**
   ```bash
   # If issues fixed and no new issues:
   gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --approve \
     --body "✅ All issues addressed. Looks good!"

   # If new issues or incomplete fixes:
   gh pr review $PR_NUMBER --comment \
     --body "Thanks for the fixes! Found a few remaining issues..."
   ```

5. **Iteration limit:**
   - Maximum 3 automated review iterations
   - After 3 iterations, suggest human review or pair programming

---

## Special Review Modes

### Security-Critical PR
If PR touches auth, payments, sensitive data:
```
- Deep security audit (30 minutes)
- Invoke compliance specialists (GDPR, PCI-DSS, SOC2)
- Require human security team review
- Block merge until security sign-off
```

### Hotfix PR
If labeled "hotfix" or "emergency":
```
- Fast review mode (15 minutes)
- Focus on logic + security only
- Skip style, architecture reviews
- Expedited approval process
```

### Documentation-Only PR
If only .md files changed:
```
- Skip code review stages
- Review documentation quality:
  - Accuracy
  - Completeness
  - Clarity
  - Examples included
- Quick approval (5 minutes)
```

### Dependency Update PR
If only package.json, requirements.txt, etc.:
```
- Security audit only
- Check for known vulnerabilities
- Verify license compatibility
- Check for breaking changes
```
