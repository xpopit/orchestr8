# Multi-Stage Code Review Workflow

You are orchestrating a comprehensive multi-stage iterative code review that evaluates code quality across multiple dimensions: style, logic, security, performance, and architecture.

## Workflow Overview

This workflow provides thorough code quality validation through specialized review stages, each focusing on a different aspect of code quality. The review is iterative, allowing developers to fix issues and re-submit for validation.

## Intelligence Database Integration

## Phase 1: Scope Detection & Preparation (0-5%)

**⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
```
Use the debugger agent to:
1. Identify what to review (full codebase, directory, file, PR, or changed files)
2. Gather context about the scope
3. Collect file lists and change information
4. Create review task list with TodoWrite
5. Estimate review complexity and duration

subagent_type: "quality-assurance:debugger"
description: "Determine review scope and prepare context"
prompt: "Analyze and prepare the code review scope:

Argument provided: $1

Tasks:

1. **Identify Review Scope:**
   - If no argument or 'all': Full codebase review
   - If directory path provided: Directory-specific review
   - If file path provided: Single file review
   - If PR number (PR-XXX): Pull request review
   - If 'changed': Review uncommitted changes

2. **Gather Context:**
   ```bash
   # For PR reviews
   if [[ \"$1\" =~ ^PR-[0-9]+$ ]]; then
     PR_NUMBER=\${1#PR-}
     gh pr view \$PR_NUMBER --json files,title,body,commits
   fi

   # For changed files
   if [ \"$1\" = \"changed\" ] || [ -z \"$1\" ]; then
     git diff --name-only
     git status --short
   fi

   # For directory/file reviews
   if [ -d \"$1\" ]; then
     find \"$1\" -type f -name \"*.{ts,js,py,java,go,rs,tsx,jsx}\" | head -100
   elif [ -f \"$1\" ]; then
     echo \"Single file: $1\"
   fi
   ```

3. **Estimate Complexity:**
   - Count files to review
   - Identify languages involved
   - Estimate review duration (5 min per file for thorough review)
   - Total expected time

4. **Create Review Task List:**
   Use TodoWrite to create tasks:
   - Stage 1: Style & Readability Review
   - Stage 2: Logic & Correctness Review
   - Stage 3: Security Audit
   - Stage 4: Performance Analysis
   - Stage 5: Architecture Review
   - Stage 6: Synthesis & Report Generation

Expected outputs:
- Review scope summary
- File list (up to 100 files)
- Complexity estimate
- Task list created
"
```

**Expected Outputs:**
- Review scope identified (full/directory/file/PR/changed)
- File list generated
- Complexity estimate (file count, duration)
- TodoWrite task list created

**Quality Gate: Scope Validation**
```bash
# Validate scope was determined
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  SCOPE="changed"
else
  SCOPE="$1"
fi

# Check if scope is valid
if [[ "$SCOPE" =~ ^PR-[0-9]+$ ]]; then
  PR_NUMBER=${SCOPE#PR-}
  if ! gh pr view $PR_NUMBER &>/dev/null; then
    echo "❌ Invalid PR number: $PR_NUMBER"
    exit 1
  fi
elif [ "$SCOPE" != "changed" ] && [ ! -d "$SCOPE" ] && [ ! -f "$SCOPE" ]; then
  echo "❌ Invalid scope: $SCOPE (not a file, directory, or PR)"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Review scope validated: $SCOPE"
```

**Track Progress:**

     echo \"✅ Posted review to PR #\$PR_NUMBER\"
   fi
   ```

3. **Create Follow-Up Plan**
   If issues found:
   - Identify which issues must be fixed before merge
   - Which stages need re-review after fixes
   - Iteration limit (max 3 iterations)
   - Escalation path if >3 iterations needed

4. **Iteration Strategy**
   - If critical issues: BLOCK merge, require fixes and re-review
   - If high issues: REQUEST changes, targeted re-review
   - If medium/low issues: APPROVE WITH CHANGES, optional re-review
   - Only re-run affected stages (e.g., if security fix → Stage 3 only)

5. **Generate Metrics**
   Create review-metrics.txt:
   - Total files reviewed
   - Total issues found (by severity)
   - Quality score
   - Review duration
   - Token usage
   - Verdict

Expected outputs:
- Report saved and delivered
- PR comment posted (if applicable)

### If Issues Found

1. **Developer Fixes Issues**
   - Address critical and high priority issues
   - Commit changes

2. **Targeted Re-review**
   ```
   # Only re-run stages affected by changes
   # If security fix: re-run Stage 3 only
   # If logic fix: re-run Stage 2 only
   # If performance fix: re-run Stage 4 only
   ```

3. **Validate Fixes**
   - Ensure issues are resolved
   - Check no new issues introduced
   - Update review report

4. **Iterate or Approve**
   - If all critical/high issues resolved: **APPROVE**
   - If new issues or incomplete fixes: **ITERATE** (max 3 iterations)
   - If >3 iterations needed: **ESCALATE** (suggest pair programming or design review)

## Best Practices

### DO ✅
- Run review before creating PR
- Address critical/high issues immediately
- Use fast mode only for true emergencies
- Iterate based on feedback (max 3 times)
- Track review metrics over time
- Automate in CI/CD pipeline
- Use database queries for efficient code access

### DON'T ❌
- Skip review for "small" changes
- Ignore low-priority issues indefinitely
- Review while tired or rushed
- Approve without reading report
- Merge with open critical issues
- Disable quality gates
- Read entire files when specific functions needed

---

## Notes

- **Parallel Execution:** Stages 1-3 can run in parallel for speed (if resources allow)
- **Iterative:** Re-review only affected stages after fixes
- **Customizable:** Adjust stages/focus based on change type
- **Automated:** Can integrate with CI/CD for automatic reviews
- **Learning:** System improves over time by tracking patterns
- **Database-First:** Uses Orchestr8 Intelligence Database for efficient code access

Your code deserves thorough review. This workflow ensures nothing slips through while maintaining development velocity.
