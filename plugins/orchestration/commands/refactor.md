# Refactor Workflow

Autonomous, safe code refactoring with test coverage, quality validation, and behavior preservation guarantees.

## Core Principles

1. **Tests First**: Ensure comprehensive tests before refactoring
2. **Small Steps**: Refactor incrementally, keeping tests green
3. **No Behavior Change**: Refactoring must not change external behavior
4. **Always Passing**: Tests must pass after every step
5. **Continuous Validation**: Run tests frequently during refactoring

## Execution Instructions

### Phase 1: Analysis & Planning (20%)

**⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
```
Use the code-archaeologist and code-reviewer agents to analyze current code and design refactoring strategy.

subagent_type: "quality-assurance:debugger"
description: "Analyze current code and identify refactoring opportunities"
prompt: "Analyze code for refactoring: $*

Tasks:
1. **Analyze Current Code**
   - Read code thoroughly
   - Identify code smells:
     - Long methods (>50 lines)
     - Large classes (>300 lines)
     - Duplicated code
     - Deep nesting (>3 levels)
     - Too many parameters (>4)
     - Feature envy
     - Shotgun surgery
     - Primitive obsession
     - Long parameter lists
   - Map dependencies
   - Check test coverage

2. **Design Refactoring Strategy**
   Create refactoring-plan.md with:

   GOAL: [What we want to achieve]

   CURRENT STATE:
   - [What the code looks like now]
   - [Problems with current design]

   TARGET STATE:
   - [What the code should look like]
   - [How it improves the design]

   REFACTORING STEPS:
   1. [Step 1 - specific, small]
   2. [Step 2 - specific, small]
   3. [Step 3 - specific, small]
   ...

   RISKS:
   - [What could go wrong]
   - [Mitigation strategies]

3. **Verify Test Coverage**
   - Check current coverage: 80%+ of code being refactored
   - If insufficient, plan test creation first

Expected outputs:
- code-analysis.md with:
  - Code smells identified
  - Dependencies mapped
  - Test coverage report
- refactoring-plan.md with:
  - Clear goal and strategy
  - Step-by-step refactoring plan
  - Risk mitigation strategies
"
```

**Expected Outputs:**
- `code-analysis.md` - Complete code smell analysis
- `refactoring-plan.md` - Detailed refactoring strategy
- Test coverage report

**Quality Gate: Planning Validation**
```bash
# Validate code analysis exists
if [ ! -f "code-analysis.md" ]; then
  echo "❌ Code analysis not created"
  exit 1
fi

# Validate refactoring plan exists
if [ ! -f "refactoring-plan.md" ]; then
  echo "❌ Refactoring plan not created"
  exit 1
fi

# Validate plan has clear steps
if ! grep -q "REFACTORING STEPS" refactoring-plan.md; then
  echo "❌ Refactoring steps not defined"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Refactoring plan complete"
```

**Track Progress:**
```bash
# Update TodoWrite with refactoring steps from plan
echo "20% - Analysis & planning complete"
```

**CHECKPOINT**: Plan approved, tests comprehensive ✓

### Phase 2: Pre-Refactoring Test Suite (15%)

**⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
```
Use the test-engineer agent to ensure comprehensive test coverage before refactoring.

subagent_type: "quality-assurance:test-engineer"
description: "Create comprehensive test suite for code being refactored"
prompt: "Create bulletproof test suite for refactoring: $*

Tasks:
1. **Characterization Tests**
   Document current behavior (even if buggy):
   - Test what the code does NOW
   - We'll maintain this behavior during refactoring
   - Cover all current functionality
   - Include edge cases

2. **Edge Case Tests**
   - Empty input
   - Null/undefined input
   - Single item
   - Boundary conditions
   - Error conditions
   - Concurrent access (if applicable)

3. **Integration Tests**
   - Test how this code interacts with rest of system
   - Verify behavior doesn't change
   - Test all integration points

4. **Performance Baselines**
   - Measure current performance
   - Set baseline metrics
   - Must maintain or improve performance

Based on: code-analysis.md

Expected outputs:
- Comprehensive test suite with:
  - Characterization tests (documenting current behavior)
  - Edge case tests (boundary and error conditions)
  - Integration tests (system interactions)
  - Performance baseline tests
- All tests PASSING
- Coverage report showing >80% for code being refactored
"
```

**Expected Outputs:**
- Comprehensive test suite files
- All tests passing
- Coverage report showing >80%
- Performance baseline established

**Quality Gate: Test Suite Validation**
```bash
# Run all tests
if ! npm test 2>/dev/null && ! python -m pytest 2>/dev/null && ! cargo test 2>/dev/null; then
  echo "❌ Tests failing before refactoring"
  exit 1
fi

# Check coverage
echo "Checking test coverage..."
# Coverage should be >80% for code being refactored

echo "✅ Comprehensive test suite in place, all passing"
```

**Track Progress:**
```bash
echo "35% - Test suite complete"
```

**CHECKPOINT**: Comprehensive test suite in place, all passing ✓

---

### Phase 3: Incremental Refactoring (50%)

**⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
```
Use the appropriate development agent to execute refactoring incrementally.

subagent_type: "[language-developers:python-developer|language-developers:typescript-developer|language-developers:java-developer|language-developers:go-developer|language-developers:rust-developer]"
description: "Execute refactoring incrementally with tests green at each step"

  echo "❌ Tests failing during refactoring - REVERT LAST CHANGE"
  exit 1
fi

# Verify refactoring log exists
if [ ! -f "refactoring-log.md" ]; then
  echo "❌ Refactoring log not maintained"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Refactoring step complete, tests still passing"

## Common Refactoring Patterns

### 1. Extract Method

**When**: Method is too long (>50 lines)

```python
# Before
def process():
    # 100 lines of code

# After
def process():
    prepare_data()
    validate_input()
    execute_operation()
    save_results()
```

### 2. Extract Class

**When**: Class has too many responsibilities

```python
# Before
class User:
    def authenticate(self): ...
    def send_email(self): ...
    def log_action(self): ...

# After
class User:
    def __init__(self):
        self.auth = AuthService()
        self.mailer = EmailService()
        self.logger = LogService()
```

### 3. Inline Method/Variable

**When**: Method/variable adds no value

```python
# Before
def get_total():
    base = get_base_price()
    return base

# After
def get_total():
    return get_base_price()
```

### 4. Replace Conditional with Polymorphism

**When**: Complex type-based conditionals

```python
# Before
def calculate(type, amount):
    if type == 'A':
        return amount * 1.5
    elif type == 'B':
        return amount * 2.0

# After
class CalculatorA:
    def calculate(self, amount):
        return amount * 1.5

class CalculatorB:
    def calculate(self, amount):
        return amount * 2.0
```

### 5. Introduce Parameter Object

**When**: Many parameters (>4)

```python
# Before
def create_user(name, email, age, address, phone, city, state, zip):
    ...

# After
@dataclass
class UserData:
    name: str
    email: str
    age: int
    address: str
    phone: str
    city: str
    state: str
    zip: str

def create_user(user_data: UserData):
    ...
```

## Success Criteria

Refactoring complete when:
- ✅ All tests passing (100%)
- ✅ Coverage maintained or improved
- ✅ Code complexity reduced
- ✅ Code smells eliminated
- ✅ SOLID principles followed
- ✅ No behavior changes
- ✅ Performance maintained
- ✅ Quality gates passed
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ Deployed successfully

## Example Usage

### Example 1: Extract Service

```bash
/refactor "Extract authentication logic from User model into AuthService for better testability and reusability"
```

**Time: 1-2 hours**

### Example 2: Eliminate Duplication

```bash
/refactor "Remove code duplication in payment processing - same logic exists in 5 different places"
```

**Time: 2-3 hours**

### Example 3: Simplify Complex Method

```bash
/refactor "Refactor process_order method - it's 200 lines long with cyclomatic complexity of 25"
```

**Time: 2-4 hours**

## Anti-Patterns

### DON'T
❌ Refactor without tests
❌ Change behavior during refactoring
❌ Make large changes all at once
❌ Skip running tests during refactoring
❌ Refactor and add features simultaneously
❌ Deploy without validation

### DO
✅ Write tests first if missing
✅ Keep behavior identical
✅ Small, incremental steps
✅ Run tests after each step
✅ Separate refactoring from feature work
✅ Validate thoroughly before deploying

Autonomous, safe, and thorough refactoring that improves code quality without breaking anything.
