# Architecture Review Workflow

You are orchestrating a comprehensive architecture review that evaluates system design, architectural patterns, scalability, security architecture, and long-term maintainability.

## Workflow Overview

This workflow provides deep architectural analysis focusing on:
1. **System Design** - Overall architecture patterns and structure
2. **Design Patterns** - SOLID principles, DRY, separation of concerns
3. **Scalability** - Horizontal/vertical scaling capabilities
4. **Security Architecture** - Defense in depth, auth/authz design
5. **Technical Debt** - Code quality, maintainability, refactoring needs
6. **Integration** - API design, coupling, cohesion
7. **Future-Proofing** - Extensibility, evolution capability

## Phase 1: Architecture Discovery & Mapping (0-15%)

**⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
```
Use the architect agent to:
1. Identify architecture type (monolith, microservices, serverless, layered)
2. Map components and dependencies
3. Identify key concerns (auth, data, business logic, integrations)
4. Create architecture map document
5. Create analysis task list

subagent_type: "development-core:architect"
description: "Discover and map system architecture"
prompt: "Analyze the system architecture and create a comprehensive map:

Scope: $1

Tasks:

1. **Identify Architecture Type**
   Use database queries to understand project structure:
   ```bash
   # Query for architectural patterns
   ```

   Determine if:
   - Monolith: Single app directory
   - Microservices: Multiple service directories
   - Serverless: Lambda/function directories
   - Layered: Clear layer separation (controllers, services, repositories)
   - Clean/Hexagonal: Ports and adapters pattern
   - Event-Driven: Message/event infrastructure
   - CQRS: Separate read/write models

2. **Map Components and Dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Find main entry points
   find . -name 'main.*' -o -name 'index.*' -o -name 'app.*'

   # Identify major modules/services
   ls -d */ | grep -E '(src|lib|services|api|modules)'

   # Check dependencies
   cat package.json requirements.txt pom.xml Cargo.toml go.mod 2>/dev/null
   ```

3. **Identify Key Concerns**
   - Authentication & Authorization
   - Data storage & access
   - Business logic location
   - External integrations
   - Caching strategy
   - Messaging/events
   - Deployment model

4. **Create Architecture Map Document**
   Create 'architecture-map.md' with:
   - Architecture type and rationale
   - Component diagram (text-based)
   - Dependency relationships
   - Key technical decisions
   - Areas of concern

Expected outputs:
- architecture-map.md
- Component and dependency mapping
- List of key architectural concerns
"
```

**Expected Outputs:**
- `architecture-map.md` - Complete architecture mapping
- Component and dependency relationships documented
- Key concerns identified

**Quality Gate: Discovery Validation**
```bash
# Validate architecture map exists
if [ ! -f "architecture-map.md" ]; then
  echo "❌ Architecture map not created"
  exit 1
fi

# Check for minimum content
LINE_COUNT=$(wc -l < "architecture-map.md")
if [ "$LINE_COUNT" -lt 20 ]; then
  echo "❌ Architecture map incomplete: $LINE_COUNT lines"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Architecture discovery complete"
```

   Use database queries:
   ```bash
   ```

4. **Generate Pattern Analysis**
   Create 'pattern-analysis.md' with:
   ```markdown
   ## Architecture Pattern Analysis

   **Current Pattern:** [Pattern Name]

   **Assessment:** [✅ Appropriate | ⚠️ Needs Improvement | ❌ Wrong Pattern]

   **Strengths:**
   - [What works well with file references]

   **Weaknesses:**
