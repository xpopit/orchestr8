# Create Workflow

Autonomous workflow for creating new orchestration workflows with comprehensive phase design, quality gates, and plugin integration.

## Intelligence Database Integration

```bash

# Initialize workflow

echo "🚀 Starting Create Workflow Workflow"
echo "Requirements: $1"
echo "Workflow ID: $workflow_id"

# Query similar workflow patterns
```

---

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis (0-20%)

**⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
```
Use the workflow-architect agent to:
1. Extract workflow specifications from user requirements
2. Identify workflow type (feature development, bug fixing, audit, deployment, optimization)
3. Assess complexity (simple/moderate/complex)
4. Determine required agents and quality gates
5. Research similar workflows for patterns

subagent_type: "meta-development:workflow-architect"
description: "Analyze requirements for new workflow"
prompt: "Analyze requirements for creating a new workflow:

Requirements: $1

Tasks:
1. **Extract Specifications**
   - What end-to-end process does this automate?
   - What are the inputs (arguments)?
   - What are the outputs (deliverables)?
   - What agents are needed?
   - What quality gates are required?

2. **Complexity Assessment**
   - Simple: 3-4 phases, 1-2 agents
   - Moderate: 5-7 phases, 3-5 agents
   - Complex: 8+ phases, 5+ agents, orchestrator needed

3. **Workflow Type Identification**
   - Feature Development: analysis → implement → test → deploy
   - Bug Fixing: triage → root cause → fix → test → deploy
   - Audit/Review: scan → review → report → remediate
   - Deployment: validate → stage → deploy → monitor → rollback
   - Optimization: profile → strategy → optimize → benchmark

4. **Research Similar Workflows**
   \`\`\`bash
   find /Users/seth/Projects/orchestr8/.claude/commands -name '*.md' | head -10
   \`\`\`

Expected outputs:
- Workflow specifications document
- Complexity assessment
- Workflow type identification
- List of required agents
- Quality gates needed
"
```

**Expected Outputs:**
- Workflow specifications document
- Complexity and type assessment
- Agent requirements list
- Quality gates list

**Quality Gate: Requirements Validation**
```bash
# Validate requirements provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  echo "❌ Workflow requirements not provided"
  exit 1
fi

echo "✅ Requirements analyzed"
```

**Track Progress:**
```bash
TOKENS_USED=4000

# Store requirements
  "Requirements for new workflow" \
  "Type: [identified], Complexity: [assessed], Agents: [list]"
```

## Phase 2: Workflow Design (20-45%)

**⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
```
Use the workflow-architect agent to:
1. Design frontmatter with description and argument-hint
2. Break down workflow into phases (4-8 phases totaling 100%)
3. Design agent coordination strategy (sequential/parallel/conditional)
4. Design quality gates with pass/fail criteria
5. Define 8-12 specific success criteria

subagent_type: "meta-development:workflow-architect"
description: "Design workflow architecture and phases"
prompt: "Design the complete workflow architecture:

Based on Phase 1 requirements, create:

1. **Frontmatter Design**
   \`\`\`yaml
   ---
   description: [Action verb] [scope] with [capabilities] - [benefits]
   argument-hint: \"[argument-format or description]\"
   ---
   \`\`\`

2. **Phase Breakdown** (must total 100%)
   - Determine number of phases (typically 4-8)
   - Assign percentage to each phase
   - Define clear phase objectives

   Examples:
   - Feature: Analysis (20%), Implementation (50%), Quality Gates (20%), Deployment (10%)
   - Bug Fix: Triage (15%), Root Cause (20%), Implementation (25%), Testing (25%), Deployment (15%)
   - Audit: Reconnaissance (15%), Scan (30%), Review (25%), Report (20%), Remediation (10%)

3. **Agent Coordination Design**
   - Sequential: When dependencies exist
   - Parallel: When tasks are independent
   - Conditional: Based on workflow specifics
   - Orchestrator: For complex coordination

4. **Quality Gates Design**
   - Code Review (code-reviewer)
   - Testing (test-engineer)
   - Security (security-auditor)
   - Performance (performance-analyzer) if applicable
   - **All gates must PASS** - no escape hatches

5. **Success Criteria** (8-12 specific, measurable criteria)
   - Cover all aspects
   - Measurable and verifiable
   - Use ✅ checkbox format

Expected outputs:
- Complete workflow design document
- Phase breakdown with percentages
- Agent coordination strategy
- Quality gates specification
- Success criteria list (8-12 items)
"
```

**Expected Outputs:**
- `workflow-design.md` - Complete workflow design
- Phase breakdown (totaling 100%)
- Agent coordination strategy
- Quality gates specification
- Success criteria list

**Quality Gate: Design Validation**
```bash
# Validate design document exists
if [ ! -f "workflow-design.md" ]; then
  echo "❌ Workflow design document missing"
  exit 1
fi

# Validate phases total 100%
# (Manual validation - check design document)

echo "✅ Workflow design validated"
```

**Track Progress:**
```bash
TOKENS_USED=5000

# Store design patterns

2. Implement frontmatter with description and argument-hint
3. Write Intelligence Database integration section
4. Implement all phases with explicit Task tool patterns
5. Add quality gates with bash validation
6. Include success criteria checklist
7. Add usage examples and anti-patterns

subagent_type: "meta-development:plugin-developer"
description: "Implement workflow markdown file"
prompt: "Implement the complete workflow file:

Based on workflow-design.md, create:

1. **File Location**: /Users/seth/Projects/orchestr8/.claude/commands/[workflow-name].md
   - Use kebab-case for filename
   - Extract workflow name from requirements

2. **Frontmatter** (from design):
   \`\`\`yaml

   description: [from design]
   argument-hint: \"[from design]\"
   ---
   \`\`\`

3. **Intelligence Database Integration**:
   \`\`\`bash
   \`\`\`

4. **Each Phase Structure**:
   \`\`\`markdown
   ## Phase N: Phase Name (X-Y%)

   **⚡ EXECUTE TASK TOOL:**
   \`\`\`
   Use the [agent-name] agent to:
   1. Specific deliverable
   2. Specific deliverable

   subagent_type: \"agent-name\"
   description: \"Brief 5-10 word description\"
   prompt: \"Detailed instructions...

   Expected outputs:
